254	PARK	Park	2012-06-02	10:00:00	17:00:00	MTHS National Trails Day	Join us for a hike at 10am to South Mountain followed by a lecture and book signing at 3:30 pm in our U&D Train Station by Alan Via.

The hike is easy with a moderate bushwhack and follows a long-abandoned trail to some historic rarely-seen sites in the North Lake area. Meet at the Mountain Top Historical Society Campus at 10 am. It's approximately 3 miles and hikers will return to the campus around 3:30pm.

At 3:30 pm, Mr. Via, author of the newly published The Catskill 67: A Hiker's Guide to the 100 Highest Peaks Under 3500', a beautifully illustrated guide - will talk about his book. He provides a wealth of information on a previously overlooked group of peaks, providing routes to the summits â€“ on trails, woods roads or bushwhacks â€“ with keen observations and a wry sense of humor. He has led hikes for the ADK, the 3500 Club and Taconic Hiking Club for the past 35 years. Mr. Via's book includes possible activities in the area other than hiking such as canoeing, fishing, biking and camping. Several photos are included, all in color, which makes this guidebook a nice addition to the collection of anyone who is interested in exploring the Catskills.

Everyone is welcome. Mr. Via's book will be available at the event for $21.95. A reception will be held after the book signing. The MTHS is suggesting a $3 per person donation to support our programs.

264	PARK	Garden	2012-06-16	10:00:00	16:00:00	Lexington Gardening Day	I am reaching out to you to pass the word on about Lexington Gardening Day. On Saturday, June 16th from 10am until 4 pm Project Hope and Cornell Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners will be helping Town of Lexington residents plant or "bring back" color to their homes. Words of sadness often heard after the "Flood" were centered around the lose of plants and gardens that had been lovingly tended.
 
At this time there are 12 residents who have asked for help, many who are just unable to do the work themselves. If you or others you know would like to be a part of this event for two or more hours please let me know. Volunteers will be weeding, and planting former or new gardens, delivering supplies to sites, setting up , cleaning up,helping where needed.There will be little "heavy" work and lots of laughter and satisfaction.
 
Lunch will be served at the Lexington Municipal Building for all volunteers and residents. Covered dishes  or  volunteers to help with lunch will be welcomed.
 
Pass the word, come help, or drop off food to share. Volunteer sign up and assignments will begin at 10am across the street from the Methodist Church on 13a.You do not have to be a gardener to volunteer.
 
Hope to see you on the 16th!

All are welcome!

What is a Handicapped Scoring Tennis Tournament???
Well, say - Matt Roll is playing against Brendan Clare - - Brendan starts the game with a 3 point lead - - so for the whole match Brendan instantly starts each game with a 3 point advantage - - if Matt makes one mistake he looses the gameâ€¦get it?
Darren will set the handicaps.

Swing by the courts or call Darren to let him know that you'd like to play in this fun event.

This type of tournament makes it enjoyable for all levels - come have some fun - - and enjoy a cookout afterwards.			254
