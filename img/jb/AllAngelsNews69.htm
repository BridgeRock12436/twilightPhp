NEWS FROM THE ALL ANGELS AUXILIARY<br><br>
The Auxiliary met on Labor Day weekend 2008 to plan for Season 2009.  We are excited about our 2009 Benefit - "Beatles Cabaret" under the artistic direction of Jim Martocci!  Jim will be reaching out to all Twilighters to lend their voices, joyful souls and creative energy with this presentation which promises to be another memorable occasion for Twilight Park.<br>
I would like to thank everyone who contributed their time, energy and devotion to Auxiliary work in 2008.  You are a loyal and dedicated group and a pleasure to work with.  I am looking forward to Summer Season 2009!<br><br>
Karen Hulse<br>

NEWS FROM THE ALL ANGELS VESTRY<br>
The Nine Lessons and Carols, December 26, 2008 – A first time event, the Nine Lessons and Carols Service proved to be a delightful success!  The Service was led by Barbara Swanson, and several people shared in the readings telling the birth of Jesus Christ followed by carols sung by everyone.  Many thanks to all who attended and participated, to the Elder family for hosting the service and to Barbara Swanson for producing a beautiful service leaflet which we plan to use for many years to come!<br>
