<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The weather forcast for this weekend indicates lows in the 20 s and<br>
some snow. Nathan and I have concluded that there is risk of freezes<br>
in small valves in both Park and Cottage pipes. Normally, the main<br>
water supply would go down on Monday, 10/19, but under the<br>
circumstances, Nathan will begin turning the water off during the<br>
course of this weekend. We recognize that this will be inconvenient<br>
to anyone who has not yet closed up, but burst pipes are equally<br>
serious. Welcome to Winter!<br>
<br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Best, Joe Keiffer
