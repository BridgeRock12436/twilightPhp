&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dear Friends,<br>
One of the best parts of teaching at Integrative Nutrition is that every<br>
day, I hear inspirational stories about the work that our grads are doing<br>
out in their communities.<br>
<br>
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month!<br>
<br>
<br>
I've recently re-connected with 2006 graduate Lydia FitzGerald.<br>
Lydia is a certified health counselor and she's doing amazing work with an<br>
organization called You Can Thrive!  This organization provides access to<br>
mind/body modalities for breast cancer survivors, including acupuncture,<br>
massage, meditation, peer support, dance and reflexology.<br>
You Can Thrive! also provides essential nutrition education to breast<br>
cancer survivors.<br>
<br>
We're hosting a special webinar: Nutrition & Wellness Tips From You Can<br>
Thrive!<br>
With Lydia on Thursday, October 22 at 5pm ET. In this webinar, Lydia will<br>
talk about one of the key components of cancer care: proper nutrition<br>
support.<br>
<br>
You'll learn:<br>
* Lydia's top nutrition tips<br>
<br>
* The importance of finding balance in the areas of relationships, career,<br>
spirituality and exercise<br>
<br>
* How Lydia's education at Integrative Nutrition inspired her to support<br>
breast cancer awareness<br>
<br>
* What you can do to support your own health and You Can Thrive!<br>
<br>
And I'm thrilled to announce!<br>
That one lucky webinar attendee will receive a full tuition scholarship<br>
for Integrative Nutrition's Distance Learning program ($4,995 value).<br>
