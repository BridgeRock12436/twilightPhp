Church of All Angels - Confirmation Class Begins Sunday July 11, 11:30 a.m.<br><br>
The Rev. Sean Cavanaugh will begin a 5 week Confirmation Class for young adults and adults who would like to learn more about the Episcopal Church.<br>
Classes will be held each Sunday at 11:30, following "Lemonade on the Lawn", in the church.<br><br>
These classes will prepare for Confirmation, and also for Reception or Reaffirmation. (See the glossary below, courtesy of the Diocese of New York).<br>
For more information, contact Sean at the rectory (589-5292) over the weekend, or at church on Sunday.<br><br>
August 8 is Confirmation Sunday, when the Bishop of Albany will officiate at this sacrament.<br><br>
Confirmation is the renewal of baptismal vows for those baptized at an early age who desire to make their first adult affirmation of faith.<br>
It is a sacrament of mature adulthood.<br><br>
Baptism, not Confirmation, admits a person to Holy Communion.<br><br>
Reception is a renewal of baptismal vows for those who have made a mature affirmation of faith in any other Christian church and who now wish to join the Episcopal Church.<br><br>
Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows is a renewal of baptismal vows for those who were baptized as adults without laying on of hands by a bishop, for those who have made a mature affirmation of faith but have returned from a lapse of Christian practice, for those concluding a period of personal or pastoral crisis, and for those who are experiencing a new call from God to grow in faith or to begin a new ministry.<br><br>
Confirmation, Reception and Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows are all performed with laying on of hands.<br>
