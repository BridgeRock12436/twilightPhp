<p>======================================</p>
<p>Submitted by your humble scribe, John Reed Gordon </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></b><font size="4">This particular August Sunday afternoon started peacefully on the 
Mountaintop, the bright sun highlighting the rustic footprint of the Twilight 
Park clubhouse, with languorous cumulus clouds floating toward the historic 
Kaaterskill Clove to the East as they cast shadows on the adjacent clay tennis 
courts. Within the hallowed log structure, a dozen volunteer laborers quietly 
toiled at their curious chosen task….setting up two world-class ping pong 
tables, as well as myriad spectator chairs, in preparation for the third annual 
Ping Pong Tournament in pursuit of the vaunted Twelka Cup! </font> </p>
<p><font size="4">The idyllic montage was suddenly and rudely interrupted, as a cacophony 
emanating from the Twilight gate house area pierced the tranquil mountain 
setting. Twelka Cup participants, early team supporters, and the volunteer 
laborers poured from the clubhouse to the expansive lawn, frightened but curious 
to determine what could be generating such an horrific clamor. They were met by 
a tall woman who I swear was the spitting image of Elka Park’s First lady. She 
was smiling coyly, and broadcasting for all to hear, &quot;They’re coming, they’re 
coming! Don’t miss this!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">There proceeded over the hill leading from the gate house a humongous armored 
battle wagon, reminiscent of those Panzer Division transport vehicles employed 
by the German army during World War II. It was filled with the entire Elka 
Twelka team in full battle regalia, as well as a number of hangers-on and PR 
types. A haunting, militaristic Wagnerian aria blared at 130 decibels from the 
vehicle’s loudspeaker system, drowning out for the most part the deprecations 
and rasberries of the raucous crowd. Elka flags and banners were waved from 
within the vehicle, and trash talking (some of it expletive deleted) emanated 
from the battle wagon and from Twilight denizens on the clubhouse lawn. Elka 
Twelka Captain Rob Constable, at the wheel of the offending Lastkraftwagen, 
audaciously decided to further foment the deteriorating situation by driving the 
vehicle for a lap around the Twilight Park roads. Word has it that he got as far 
as the swimming pool, where he was greeted, deep in enemy territory, by a 
jeering mob of Twilighters in bathing suits and flippers who were incensed by 
this intrusion into their laps regimen. The frightened Elkan contingent 
hightailed it back to the clubhouse, quickly exited their offending vehicle, and 
cautiously entered the ping pong venue en masse, to a mixture of cheers and 
boos.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the meantime, the somewhat shaken Twilight competitors and their entourage 
gathered in the clubhouse board room for their grand entrance which, compared to 
Elka’s dramatic arrival, now might not be so &quot;grand&quot;. The team had been asked to 
wear a similar &quot;uniform&quot; consisting of a striped shirt, khaki pants and 
sneakers, but that instruction was apparently lost on some of the Twilight 
contestants. The traditional burnt cork was applied under the eyes of the team 
as an intimidation factor, but there was little reaction from the group, whose 
mood seemed somber, even pensive. Co-Captain Gordon appeared especially upset, 
as he had for the last week forced himself to consume an inordinate amount of 
wine to provide the numerous corks required for the eye shading, and felt 
unappreciated for his sacrifice. The grand procession started as &quot;We are the 
champions&quot;, the 1977 power anthem by Freddie Mercury &amp; Queen, blasted from the 
boom box on the clubhouse stage. Alex Sade, who remains secretly married to 
Twilight Co-Captain Ellen Lasch, was the source of this appropriate theme song, 
stored on his ipod just for this occasion. While the song was justified due to 
Twilight’s towering Twelka triumph in 2007, there remained the question of the 
moment…&quot;what about 2008?&quot; That question would soon be answered. The procession 
was led by Twilight flag bearers Katie and Caroline Sade, followed by the nine 
Twilight contestants, who snaked their way through a mostly supportive crowd of 
well wishers until the music faded. The heralded Twelka Cup in all its shining 
glory graced the clubhouse stage in the background, tenderly wrapped in a silken 
blanket on a four foot high pedestal. Two brand new, world class ping pong 
tables were strategically placed back-to-back so that the spectator viewing was 
maximized, and the sun glare minimized. The glare from the gleaming Twelka Cup, 
however, could not be avoided, but no one seemed to mind.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Twilight Co-Captains Ellen Lasch and yours truly, John Gordon, along with 
Elka Captain Rob Constable, each made some opening remarks, which were for the 
most part friendly, in the traditional Twelka spirit of camaraderie. The rules 
were reviewed, the respective teams and seeds announced, and then the official 
call was made &quot;for the games to begin&quot;. A newly introduced gong was rung to 
signal the start; it would be rung throughout the day by percussionist Caroline 
Sade after each match was decided, and rung once during the midpoint of two 
matches, to make sure participants were paying attention. Some were, some 
weren’t.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The lineup was as follows:</font></p>
<p><i><b>CATEGORY SEED TWILIGHT CONTESTANT ELKA CONTESTANT</p>
</b></i>
<p>KIDS (16-12) 1 WILL BENNETT BLAISE TANGNEY</p>
<p>KIDS (11&amp;UNDER) 1 RYAN CLARE AIDEN GIBBONS</p>
<p>WOMEN 1 LAURA CLARE CATHERINE TANGNEY</p>
<p>WOMEN 2 ELLEN LASCH ANNE SANSEVERO</p>
<p>WOMEN 3 ROBIN M. KAUKONEN PEGGY BURKE</p>
<p>MEN 1 PETER BENNETT BRIAN FLYNN</p>
<p>MEN 2 JOHN GORDON ROB CONSTABLE</p>
<p>MEN 3 JOHN GALATTI WIG GARCIA</p>
<p>MEN 4 TOM BRAUNSTEIN PAT GIBBONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Note that genetics appear to be a dominant force among the 
2008 contestants; no fewer than four families have two representatives in this 
year’s finals: Bennett, Clare, Gibbons and Tangney! </font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Twelka Cup Finals started with two exciting Kids’ matches: 
First-time Twilight competitor Will Bennett versus seasoned Elkan veteran Blaise 
Tangney in the 16-12 age bracket, and young Twilight dynamo Ryan Clare versus 
his worthy Elkan opponent, Aiden Gibbons. Both matches were extremely well 
played, with Blaise and Ryan eventually prevailing</font>. <i><b><br>
TWILIGHT 1 ELKA 1</p>
<p></b></i><font size="4">Next up were the Women’s third seeds, and the Men’s 
fourth seeds. Twilight first-timer Robin Mechlowitz Kaukonen met Elkan newcomer 
Peggy Burke, and Twilight’s secret weapon from 2007, Tom Braunstein, met Elka’s 
grizzled veteran, Pat Gibbons, a three-time Twelka Cupper. The &quot;P’s&quot; prevailed, 
as Peggy and Pat bested their worthy opponents.<br>
</font>&nbsp;<i><b>TWILIGHT 1 ELKA 3</b></i> </p>
<p><font size="4">During a lull in the action, a mysterious woman quietly 
entered the clubhouse through one of the side entrances. She was adorned with a 
rack of faux deer antlers, an apparently revered Elka Park symbol equivalent to 
the beloved Twilight owl. She clasped tightly a half dozen additional deer 
antler racks in her hand, which she proceeded to hawk unashamedly to the 
surprised crowd. Since she looked exactly like a popular local actress, since 
she claimed she was married to Elka’s #4 Men’s seed, and since her initials 
ostensibly were &quot;JG&quot;, the Twilight Promoters overlooked her clear violation of 
local ordinance # 73-008, &quot;selling antlers without a license&quot;. As it turned out, 
owls would have been a quicker sale, and she was stuck with a few racks, which 
were later found appropriately stuffed in a trash barrel. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Around this time your scribe completed an unofficial count of 
those present, and came up with 62! It appears that the Twelka Cup Finals have 
become a &quot;must-see&quot; event on the busy Twilight and Elka calendars. The Promoters 
have once again downplayed the notion posed by certain doubters that the free 
beer, wine, soda and munchies had anything at all to do with swelling the crowd. 
Nonetheless, it must be reported that everything (except a private stash 
reserved for the Promoters) was consumed before the games had ended. It should 
also be noted that the Promoters offered not a drop of the obscure German swill 
the Elkans seem to prefer, sticking with classic Heineken, Coors Light and 
Budweiser. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Back to the action! The next matches featured Women’s #2 seeds 
Ellen Lasch, from Twilight, versus Anne Sansevero, from Elka, and Men’s #3 seeds 
John Galatti, from Twilight, versus Wig Garcia, from Elka. Each Park won one 
match, as Ellen became a three-time Twelka winner, and John succumbed to Wig in 
a close match.<br>
</font><i><b>TWILIGHT 2 ELKA 4</p>
<p></b></i><font size="4">With three matches to go, Elka Park held a commanding 
two match lead at this point. As was only fitting, the top Women’s seeds and the 
two top Men’s seeds would determine who would be the 2008 Twelka Cup victors! 
First up were top Twilight Women’s seed Laura Clare, opposed by top Elka Women’s 
seed Catherine Tangney, and Twilight’s scrappy but aging Co-Captain, yours 
truly, versus Elka’s much younger Co-Captain, Rob Constable. This was the third 
time that these competitors had met in the Twelka Cup, and Gordon, having lost 
the first two matches, was starting to suspect a &quot;mole&quot; in his ranks. The ladies 
played a wonderful match, I am told, with Laura prevailing. In the men’s match 
Rob was &quot;yin&quot; to Gordo’s &quot;yang&quot;, with Rob’s repeated sweeping forehand slams 
being defensively returned with backspin-laced forehands and backhands. But Rob 
was clearly more consistent, and became Twelka’s second three-time winner.</font>
<i><b><br>
TWILIGHT 3 ELKA 5</p>
</b></i>
<p><font size="4">Since Elka Park had already won the five matches required for 
victory, the last match was played as an &quot;exhibition&quot; match, featuring the top 
Men’s competitors, Peter Bennett from Twilight, and Brian Flynn from Elka. With 
both players demonstrating the most skilled ping pong of the day, Brian bested 
Peter in two close games. </font><i><b><br>
TWILIGHT 3 ELKA 6</p>
</b></i>
<p><font size="4">In the third annual Ping Pong Finals in pursuit of the vaunted 
Twelka Cup, Elka Park had won the 2008 event, 6 matches to 3, thereby reserving 
the right to hold and display the TWELKA CUP in their home Park for the next 
year. This was a decisive victory, and all Elkans are to be congratulated on 
their play! And their sportsmanship!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Next year, Elka Park will host the fourth annual Twelka Cup 
Finals in their clubhouse. The Promoters thank all of the players for their 
participation, and all of the fans who witnessed history in the making again. 
Twilight may be licking its wounds right now, but next year, I can assure you, a 
reinvigorated and rededicated team will take the stage …. Maybe with some new 
faces.</font></p>
