The passing of Walser Janeway, our eldest Twilighter</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="black">
Walser Janeway died on February 8th after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease just after his 94th birthday.<br>
He left us quietly Tuesday at noon after bidding farewell to his beloved wife Ann and treasured dog, Jag.<br>
Walser was born February 1st, 1917 on Staten Island, NY to Dr. William Richard Janeway and Carolyn Rodman Janeway.<br>
He was educated at South Kent School and Princeton University.<br>
He left college to pursue work and was soon inducted into Army Air Force flight school.<br>
He flew many missions from Foggia, Italy, returning home after the World War II to raise his family of four boys as an Air Force,<br>
then Pratt and Whitney Aircraft employee.<br>
He loved his friends and family and his Twilight Park summers.<br><br>
A time of remembrance and celebration is being planned for August in Twilight Park.<br>
--<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Whitney<br>
