<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is with great sadness that we would like to tell you that Joyce Ann Meyer died early on the morning of Saturday, December 5th, 2009.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Joyce ended her year-long struggle with lung cancer in peace, surrounded by her family and loved ones at her home in Twilight Park.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Thank you all for the many gifts, well wishes and prayers that we received throughout this last year.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Joyce was comforted by the knowledge that she had so many dear friends who were pulling for her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Joyce's final wishes were to be cremated and buried in the garden at All Angels Church, in Twilight Park.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We will be planning a Memorial Service at All Angels Church in the Summer of 2010.  More information to follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Joyce is survived by her husband Bernhard, and children Christoph, Jane and Rob.  We will miss her very, very much.<br>
<br>
