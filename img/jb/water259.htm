IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT WATER SUPPLY
<p><font size="5">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Due to the continued dry spell and lack of significant rain in the forecast,<br>
I'm requesting that you don't water gardens and try to conserve water whenever possible.<br>
We are still using reservoir water, but may have to switch to the wells early next week.<br>
Also, please let me know about any leaks, no matter how small they seem.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Every week or two,I switch to the wells for a day just to ensure the they are working<br>ok.
When I did this last  wednsday, you may you may have noticed a strong odor in the<br>
water This is due to sulfur in the water from one of our wells. The sulphur smell is accentuated when the well water is stored in the large tank.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I've taken steps to deal with the sulphur smell and will try to keep well  #1 off line for<br>
 now. There will still be some smell for two days or so until the tank water is used, and the<br>
fresh well water mixes in, the water may have an unpleasant smell but is safe.<br>
<br>
