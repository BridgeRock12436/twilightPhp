<p><font size="4">Dear Cottagers,<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is with real regret that I announce that Fernando Viana has 
retired from the Board.<br>
He was only a few months short of two full terms, but the birth of his daughter 
Tessa, and <br>
some new consulting work have led him to want to reclaim some of his time for 
himself. Fernando <br>
has been very generous with his time, and has offered highly valued counsel to 
me, Peter Swords<br>
&nbsp;and Bob Elder. I have very much enjoyed working with Fernando, relied on 
his meticulous <br>
analytical approach, and wish to thank him for the thorough and wholehearted way 
in which he<br>
&nbsp;fulfilled his Board service. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We are very fortunate that Allan Lans has agreed to take Fernando's 
place on the Board. <br>
Allan began his career as an M.D. and had a family practice for about twenty 
years, before becoming <br>
a psychiatrist. In that capacity he has been the Clinical Director of the 
Smithers Institute, the resident <br>
psychiatrist for the New York Mets, is now an Assistant Clinical Professor of 
Psychiatry at Columbia,<br>
&nbsp;and has a private practice. It is anticipated that he will bring 
humanistic and interpersonal skills to the <br>
Board which we have not seen since Socrates was a member! We very much look 
forward to welcoming <br>
him at the May meeting. <br>
<br>
