The passing of Lizzie O'Donnell</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="black">
At 12:10 pm, today, January 17, 2011, age 58, in the 17th year of her heroic struggles against an array of life-threatening illnesses,<br>
my sweet Lizzie crossed the River of this Life to go to her eternal home. Her breathing had been labored all morning, but towards noon,<br>
it shallowed out, became slower, drifted into longer intervals, and finally stopped.<br>
Nick, Andrew, Mary (her sister), David (her brother), and I were all there at the moment of her passage from this life to the next.<br><br>
