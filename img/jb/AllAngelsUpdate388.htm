Friends and Fellow Cottagers:<br><br>
Whenever possible, All Angels has been making purchases of relief supplies from local merchants.<br>
Commerce on the Mountain Top has taken a hit, and we feel we get a multiplier effect by channeling your contributions through businesses in the affected communities. 
This policy has yielded dividends. Williams Lumber has shown their support for our efforts and for the Mountain Top community by extending a generous discount to All Angels on all supplies and equipment we purchase for hurricane relief<br><br>
The attached photo shows Nathan Hommel, with help from the employees of Williams, loading his truck with Shop Vacs, dehumidifiers, and box fans. Friday evening he and Barbie Swanson delivered this equipment to relief organizations in Lexington and Prattsville.<br><br>
As the clean-up progresses and the weather changes, needs are also beginning to change. Space heaters have been added to equipment on our purchase list. The mix of needed supplies changes on an almost daily basis, but we feel that because of the contacts we have established we are able to provide prompt and meaningful assistance.<br><br> 
Thanks to everyone who has supported this fund and to those who continue to lend their time and labor to this project.<br><br>
