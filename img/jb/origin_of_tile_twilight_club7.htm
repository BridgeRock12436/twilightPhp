<ul>
  <p>ORIGIN OF THE TWILIGHT CLUB(S)<br>
  </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>(presented by Dean Davies at &quot;The Chapel&quot;, August 21, 2003)<br>
  </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>Sponsored by Twilight Club II<br>
  </p>
  <p>For two reasons it&nbsp; is highly appropriate that we talk about the 
  origin of the Twilight Club here in our cottage,<br>
&nbsp;the former Park Union Chapel 
  this year.. It was 120 years ago on January 4, 1883, that the Club was 
  founded. <br>
  The Twilight Club's chief factotum, Charles F Wingate, was not only 
  the Founder of Twilight Park, but it was <br>
  96 years ago — September 4, 1909 — 
  that his funeral was performed here in this building.<br>
  </p>
  <p>But what about the implication that there was more than one Twilight Club? 
  Well, there is an element of mystery<br>
&nbsp;which may never be completely solved, but 
  a considerable amount of research has provided enough information <br>
  to tell the 
  story. In October, 2002, Lila Memhard put me in touch with Marylee Bacharach 
  who had discovered <br>
  a web site for The Twilight Club which had nothing to do 
  with Wingate's Club. In e-mail correspondence from <br>
  Marylee, she said, &quot;I have 
  communicated with Laara Lindo several times and have enjoyed reading The 
  Club's <br>
  literature.&quot; her description turned out to be accurate and succinct. 
  She said, &quot;Their world view is very comprehensive <br>
  and inclusive.&quot;<br>
  </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>The section proceeded to &quot;The First Era l870's - 1895 The Founders&quot; and 
  showed pictures of Spencer, Emerson, <br>
  Whitman, Edwin Markham, Andrew Carnegie 
  and Mark Twain with quotes beside each. However, there was nothing <br>
  about 
  dates, meeting places, or information about the &quot;club&quot;. This was enough to 
  stimulate a request of Marylee <br>
  Bacharach for Laara Lindo's e-mail address 
  which she kindly supplied. This led to a number of exchanges with <br>
  Ms Lindo, a 
  poet and the President of the &quot;University of Science and Philosophy&quot;. In an 
  e-mail [Oct. 26, '02] she said <br>
  &quot;Thanks so much for the Charles F. Wingate 
  information. I have read the book that relates the history of this [sic] 
  <br>
  branch of the Twilight Club (there were several offshoots of the club as a 
  result of the inspiration of Herbert Spencer's <br>
  visits to and lectures in 
  America) Our documentation is of another, but related branch, several of the 
  members being <br>
  active in both groups.<br>
  </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>It is of note that a thorough study of Spencer's life reveals that he 
  visited the United States only once -- in 1882.<br>
  Regarding the &quot;documentation&quot; of the other &quot;related branch&quot;, Laara Lindo very kindly sent me several documents 
  including <br>
  &quot;The Twilight Manifesto&quot; Written and compiled by Yasuhiko Genku Kimura; the Third Year Commemorative Edition 
  <br>
  of &quot;The Cosmic Light&quot;, a quarterly journal of the University of Science &amp; Philosophy [January, 2002] a flyer entitled<br>
  &quot;The Twilight Club/Center for Evolutionary Ethics&quot;; and a 136 page book 
  by Kimura entitled &quot;Think Kosmically; <br>
  Act Globally: An Anthology of Essays on Ethics, Spirituality, and Metascience&quot;.<br>
  Suffice it to say that the masthead of The Cosmic Light showed that Kimura was 
  the C.E.O. of the University as <br>
  well as the Executive Director of the division called The Twilight Club/Center 
  for Evolutionary Ethics. Much of <br>
  the printed information about the Club that Ms Lindo sent duplicated that 
  found on the web site and apparently was <br>
  based on the memory of Walter Russell who was speaking in 1956 about the 
  history of &quot;The Science of Man&quot; <br>
  movement. He had joined the Twilight Club in 1895 at the age of 24. It seems 
  that Spencer &quot;went to his friends <br>
  here in America, Ralph Waldo Emerson, James Howard Bridge...Richard Watson 
  Gilder (who was President <br>
  and editor of Century Magazine at that time), Oliver Wendell Holmes, Walt 
  Whitman, Edwin Markham, <br>
  Henry Holt (a publisher of great vision), John Burroughs, Mark Twain [not 
  Samuel Clemens?] and Andrew Carnegie.
  </p>
  <p>Together these men formed a little gathering and called themselves The 
  Twilight Club because they met at each <br>
  others houses at twilight to discuss the things that weighed heavily upon 
  Herbert Spencer's heart.&quot;I was curious, <br>
  so I looked up biographies of some of these men..Richardson's biography of 
  Ralph Waldo Emerson never mentions <br>
  Herbert Spencer, Andrew Carnegie, Mark Twain or Edwin Markham. A highly 
  detailed two volume biography <br>
  of John Burroughs by Clara Barrus says Burroughs admired Emerson but only met 
  him once.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;The &quot;History&quot; continues with descriptions of Ten Eras, much of which 
  involves the cooperative efforts of Walter <br>
  Russell with famous and notable people like Carnegie, Alexis Carrell, Dan 
  Beard, (who started the Scout movement in America), <br>
  John Dewey and Thomas J. Watson (IBM). Russell quotes Andrew Carnegie: &quot;Now, 
  you are all authors, <br>
  Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Markham, everybody. I'll give you a building. You'll 
  have no expense <br>
  whatsoever, no membership dues, no servants to pay for, nothing. It's your 
  buildings, your club, and we'll call it <br>
  the Authors Club upon agreement that each of you writes something every year 
  that has a direct bearing and <br>
  reference to this moral code, whether it be a story or whatever.&quot; 'And he did 
  just that.' [The moral code was <br>
  &quot;The Poets Code of Ethics of ten points stimulated by Herbert Spencer's 
  proposal] It Is clear that the identity <br>
  kept changing to Science of Man, The Society of Arts and Sciences, The Walter 
  Russell Foundation in Swannanoa, <br>
  Waynesboro, Virginia, and The University of Science and Philosophy. The 
  &quot;rebirth&quot; of the Twilight Club took place<br>
&nbsp;in 1997 under the leadership of Laara Lindo, President. In 1999 Yasuhiko 
  Kimura joined the University as <br>
  Executive Director of the new Twilight Club. Within the past year there has 
  apparently been a separation of <br>
  responsibilities at the University so that Kimura and Lindo now publish VIA: 
  The Journal of New Thinking for <br>
  New Action, the Masthead having no reference to the University of Science and 
  Philosophy and showing <br>
  &quot;Vision in Action&quot; instead of The Twilight Club.<br>
  <br>
  On July 17, 2003, I wrote Laara Lindo that &quot;I confess to some frustration in 
  relating the Twilight Club you <br>
  write about with Charles Wingate's Club for which we have more than adequate 
  documentation as to founders, <br>
  dates and places. If you have some specifics other than Walter Russell's 
  memories, I would greatly appreciate <br>
  your letting me have them. I would, of course, provide attribution for any 
  additional information which you send me.<br>
  &quot; In response, some nine days later, Laara Lindo sent a very cordial letter 
  recognizing the quite different venue now, <br>
  with VIA rather than Cosmic Light, without mentioning anything about the 
  origin of the original Twilight Club.<br>
  A contrast between the stories told by Walter Russell and paraphrased by Laara 
  Lindo in The Twilight Manifesto, <br>
  on the one hand, and the comments by Yasuhiko Kimura, on the other, is 
  striking. Kimura, in a few pages, says:<br>
  &quot;The Twilight Club is an invitation for an inspired moral action....<br>
  The Twilight Club is a catalyst for the creation of a new global....<br>
  The Twilight Club is not an organization to join <br>
  The Twilight Club is an ethical movement....<br>
  The Twilight Club is a philosophic movement....&quot;<br>
  Perhaps it was a big club in the sense that those who believe in peace and 
  justice and deplore greed and violence <br>
  belong to a big club. On the other hand, it is nearly impossible to prove a 
  negative.<br>
  <br>
  THE REINCARNATION: TWILIGHT CLUB II<br>
  Since the Twilight Manifesto mentions the &quot;rebirth&quot; of The Twilight Club in 
  1997, it is fitting to review the circumstances <br>
  of the beginnings of Twilight Club II before discussing the origins of the 
  &quot;Wingate&quot; Twilight Club.<br>
  From the first feeler to enquire. about the interest of Twilighters in forming 
  a reincarnated Twilight Club, it has had <br>
  an open membership in the Park. Over the entry way of the Davies &quot;Chapel&quot; is 
  the date 1897, the date of the <br>
  completion of Park Union Chapel. So to celebrate the 100th<b><i> </i></b>
  Anniversary of the Chapel, Alice and I had an Open House. <br>
  All who came were encouraged to consider answering the question SHOULD THE 
  TWILIGHT CLUB BE RE-FORMED? <br>
  Those who thought &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; were asked to sign up for a get-together 
  later. Eight signed as singles or couples <br>
  and shortly afterwards eight more indicated their interest. A second 
  invitation was pubilished in the July 25, 1997, <br>
  issue of the Twilight Owl. The number signing up being manageable for dinner 
  meetings, the first few meetings were<br>
  in homes. Since the two organizational meetings, there have been two meetings 
  each summer — July and August.<br>
  Since last year the meetings have been announced in the Twilight Calendar as 
  &quot;sponsored by&quot; Twilight <i>Club </i>II.<br>
  <br>
  WINGATE'S TWILIGHT CLUB<br>
  Until recently the primary source of information about the early days of the 
  Twilight Club came from Joel Benton's<br>
&nbsp;book, &quot;Memories of the Twilight Club&quot; and his grand niece, Susan Underhill 
  Eltinge. A recent visit to the Haines <br>
  Falls library for the first time in current memory established the connection 
  between Herbert Spencer and the Club.<br>
  The credit goes to Paul MacGahan, John's father, who spelled out the true 
  beginnings of this club. The story is told<br>
&nbsp;in a pamphlet found in a stack of folders on Twilight Park from a filing 
  cabinet in the Haines Falls Library. A chapter <br>
  on &quot;The Twilight Idea&quot; by Paul MacGahan, one of the early owners at Twilight, 
  tells it this way:<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The Twilight idea was born in the winter of 1882-3 in New York City as two 
  friends were walking home together <br>
  from a banquet at Delmonicco's at which Herbert Spencer had made an after 
  dinner speech referring to the need <br>
  for relaxation, thus:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &quot;We have had too much of the Gospel of Work;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &quot;It is time to preach the Gospel of Relaxation.&quot;</p>
  <p>So there is the connection with Herbert Spencer! &quot;Within a few weeks a 
  dinner club, to meet once or twice a <br>
  month at some convenient restaurant, was launched.... It was an informal 
  organization, without dues, and therefore <br>
  young men just started on their careers, whose ideas were of interest, could 
  be invited to join without the expense <br>
  of membership. After some discussion, one of the founders, the Rev. J.H.Suydam, 
  of Jersey City, proposed that <br>
  the group be known as The Twilight Club, and this name was adopted. Whether 
  Spencer inspired several other <br>
  &quot;branches&quot; of Twilight Clubs, we can not say, but we know the names of the 
  charter members. In the absence of <br>
  other officers, Charles F. Wingate was made &quot;Secretary&quot;; he made all the 
  arrangements, chose the speakers, and <br>
  kept the meetings alive.<br>
  <br>
  OVERLAPS AND DIFFERENCES<br>
  Richard Watson Gilder, president and editor of Century magazine was a 
  prominent member of the Club described <br>
  by Russell and is also listed as a member of the Wingate Twilight Club. John 
  Burroughs, mentioned as a prominent <br>
  member by Russell is not in the long list of members in Joel Benton's book, 
  but his picture at Twilight Park is found <br>
  in John MacGahan's book &quot;Twilight Park: The First Hundred Years&quot;.. Another 
  connection&quot; is that Joel Benton, poet <br>
  laureate of Wingate's club had a brother, Myron, who was a good friend of John 
  Burroughs, active in the Twilight <br>
  Club described by Laara Lindo.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The most distinguishing feature between the two clubs was one of style. 
  Wingate's was totally egalitarian<br>
&nbsp;(No dues; No Party Politics; No Cant; No Humbug, etc). Benton paints a 
  picture of a light-hearted, good humored <br>
  social club, but with topics discussed ranging from &quot;Should Criminals be 
  Punished or Reformed?&quot;, &quot;Have you lost faith <br>
  in democracy?&quot; and &quot;The Church of the Future&quot;. Russell and Lindo describe an 
  elite Club of celebrities and famous <br>
  or wealthy people. Lastly, about Charles F. Wingate, Benton says &quot;...he was a 
  born idealist and altruist. He used <br>
  all his powers to make the world better, to help humanity upward....In the 
  Twilight Club, if it should revive and go on, <br>
  he will have no adequate successor; and so the memory of it will always 
  tenderly recall him.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br>
  I want to give special credit to Dick Pedersen who most generously loaned me 
  his copy of Joel Benton's book <br>
  &quot;Memories of the Twilight Club&quot;, written within a year of Wingate's death in 
  1909. I am also indebted to the late <br>
  and memorable Susan Underhill Eltinge, Charles F. Wingate's grand niece, who 
  wrote &quot;Highlights of Twilight History&quot; <br>
  in 1971.. She was the grand daughter of General George W. Wingate who was a 
  charter member of the Twilight Club <br>
  as well as President of Twilight Park at its beginning. Special appreciation 
  goes to John MacGahan who wrote <br>
  &quot;Twilight Park: The First Hundred Years&quot; which includes a section on the 
  Twilight Club, and to Justine Hummel <br>
  who shared her copious files about Twilight. In researching the biographies of 
  those who were prominent members <br>
  of the &quot;other&quot; Twilight Club, I used three libraries and examined e.g. two 
  volume biographies of John Burroughs <br>
  and Herbert Spencer and Spencer's two volume Autobiography. The gem of 
  information, however, was found <br>
  in Haines Falls Library with Connie's kind help.</p>
