&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We are very sorry to share the news of the death of our Mother Sara Mainzer on 1 April.  This summer there will be a memorial<br> 
service and internment of ashes at All Angels, followed by a reception.  We hope you will be able to join us, and will announce <br>
the date when plans firm up.  Below is the obituary that will be published in the Windham Journal.  Attached is a photo of Sara <br>
taken in the 1970’s.  We also scanned it in a higher resolution if anyone would like to have it.<br>
