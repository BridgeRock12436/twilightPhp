2009 All Angels Benefit - A Cabaret</font></p>
<p><font size="5" color="black">
To My Fellow Twilighters and Drama Queens:<br><br>
The Auxiliary of All Angels is pleased to announce that its Annual Benefit will be held on Saturday, August 1st.<br>
We will be organizing and producing an Evening Cabaret, an event which has been successful (and a great deal of fun!) in years past.<br>
Mack Elder will supply the book, and Katrina Swanson Pulichene will serve as Stage Manager and Choreographer !<br><br>
This Theme, for 2009: The Music of the Beatles!!! <br><br>
So first, I must:<br><br>
1) Try to determine just how many Twilighters, aged 16 or older, might be interested in participating in the Cabaret; and<br><br>
2) Poll all those interested: What particular Beatles tune are you drawn to, tunes you would like to perform individually or in partnership with other Twilighters?<br><br>
In this way, we can begin to envision the scope of the show, the flow, the number of singers, gather up sheet music, etc.<br><br>
My home phone is (201) 848-9177 or simply email to jtrjim@optonline.net !!<br><br>
So please think about auditioning for the Twilight Cabaret! We Need You!!!<br><br>
