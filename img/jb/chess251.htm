CHESS COMES TO TWILIGHT!<br><br>
Uma Dhar's fabulous, fun and brilliant Chess teacher will be visiting Twilight next week,<br>
Thur July 29th and Fri July 30th !!<br><br>
Tyler will be teaching the campers late morning by the pool but is then free after 1pm for private lessons, group lessons or a giant challenge of all of us against him!!!<br><br>
I have to say that for Uma to know at the age of 4 how to play chess is remarkable but it is thanks to Tylers' talents and how much fun he makes it. He even plays the saxophone, dresses up and has chess songs!!!<br>
Uma has come along way from "mama, did you know the king and queen have eight children?"<br><br>
Here is some info on our chess VIP:<br>
Tyler Schwartz is a rising chess talent in NYC. Tyler learned to play, at "The Village Chess Shop," where he worked for 3 years. For the past 2 years Tyler has been the "Chess Specialist" for Washington Market School,<br>
inventing new exciting curriculum designed at communicating the abstract nature of chess to children.  Tyler also teaches private lessons in Manhattan, with the age of students ranging from 4 years to 35 years old.<br>
In 2009 Tyler won the U1600 tournament at the World-Famous Marshall Chess Club, with an undefeated score of 5-0-0.<br><br>
Above is his email address if you want to feel free to contact him with any questions or bookings-but don't scare him away:-)<br><br>
Sandra Gooder has also kindly offered to host him.....so he can be reached at her cottage too.<br><br>
Can't wait-the guy is a blast and a genius and oh, did I mention very cute?<br><br>
Thanks!<br>
