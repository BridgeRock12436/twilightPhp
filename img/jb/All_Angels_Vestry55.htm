A message from the All Angels Vestry to Twilight Park --
<br><br>
Merry Christmas and joyful blessings to you all!
<br><br>
The members of  the Vestry have planned a service of Lessons and Carols that will be held on Friday, December 26 at 5:00 p.m.  The Elders have graciously agreed to host our service   Hors d'oeuvres, wine and soft beverages will be served following the service.  
<br><br>
We are looking forward to this "first time" event at Twilight Park.  If you are spending the holidays in the Park, please join us for what we hope will be the first of many Christmas services in the future.  Your holiday guests are welcome, as well!  
<br><br>
If you plan to attend we would appreciate your donation of hors d'oeuvres or cheese plate,   Also, as a courtesy to our hosts, please let me know how many from your household will be attending the service.
<br><br>
Best wishes,
<br><br>
Doug Hulse
Senior Warden, Memorial Church of All Angels
