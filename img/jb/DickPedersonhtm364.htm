The passing of Dr. Richard Pedersen</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="black">
Dr. Richard Pedersen passed away peacefully at home on Monday.<br> 
As his friend and fellow cottager the Reverend Fred Burnham wrote, Dick was "a person of peace, moderation and conciliation.<br>
I loved him for his modest byut crystal clear mind, his soft-spoken but discerning spirit and his joy in people and life".<br><br>
A memorial service celebrating his life will be held at the All Angels Church on Saturday August 6th at 3 pm.<br>
Immediately following the service, there will be a reception at Dick and Nelda's cottage, Moonshine. All are warmly invited to attend.<br><br>
