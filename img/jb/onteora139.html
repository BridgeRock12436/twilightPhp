&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dear Fellow Cottagers,
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am told that Twilighters who have chosen to accept
Onteora's "Dining Membership" have been using the lake at Onteora. 
<br>"Dining Membership" at Onteora entitles one only to
use the Field House for meals; this membership does not entitle Twilighters to
<br>
use any other Onteora facility, including the lake. It would be a shame if this 
amenity for us all were withdrawn due to abuse by a few. 
<br>Please be as respectful
of the Onteora rules as we would expect them to be of ours.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Many thanks!
<br>
Joe Kieffer
