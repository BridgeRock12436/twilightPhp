The Twilight Web Page with The Twilight Directory </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">My.&nbsp; I have enjoyed monitoring the Twilight web site for the 
last eight years. It has been great to get an early view <br>
of Twilight and Mountain Top happenings, births, weddings and Twilight Art Shows 
as well as a chance to mirror <br>
the Twilight Owls, Snowy Owls, all the important updates from Whitney Janeway&nbsp;and bulletins from the Board and <br>
Superintendents.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now there is a whole generation here in the Park who have 
grown up with the Internet and know how to use it and <br>
program it. John and Nora Galatti with their Twilight Directory have shown the 
many new ways that the Internet <br>
can be used make Twilight work better and connect to the outside world.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Twilight Web Page at www. twilightpark.com&nbsp; will be 
combined with the Twilight Directory but the address will remain<br>
<a href="http://www.twilightparkrock.com">www.twilightpark.com</a>. Most of 
the material from 2005 through 2008 has been saved and selected pieces from <br>
December 2000 (Y2K)&nbsp; to 2005 may also be available.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The shifting of the web site and the new combined web site 
will be available September 24. You will receive<br>
login instructions as a &quot;Twilight Web Page Update&quot; from me and also from John 
and Nora from their hosting service,<br>
Panther. There are always a few problems in fitting two web sites together but 
there is no doubt that it will become<br>
a very valuable community tool.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Of course, John, Nora and I will be available to make the 
transition as smooth as possible.</font></p>
