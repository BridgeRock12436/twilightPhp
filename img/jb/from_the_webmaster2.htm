<p><font face="Vladimir Script" size="6">from the Webmaster&nbsp;&nbsp; 
September 2006</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The time has come for the yearly clean 
up of&nbsp; the Web Page and to get ready for the coming 2007<br>
season at Twilight. There will be new approaches to internet Twilight 
Information in 2007 that will <br>
make us a more cohesive community and cut down on some of the paperwork. <br>
<br>
John Galatti and Nora Monaco have launched an online Twilight Directory which 
can be modified by the <br>
cottager to keep it up to date and makes sending emails to the entire community 
much easier. Listing of <br>
Twilighters and their families will be easier to keep accurate. A link to this 
valuable communication facility <br>
is listed at the top of the Twilight Web Page as &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Twilight 
Directory</font>&quot;. John and Nora are very helpful in its use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2006 saw the use of PDF files by Terry 
Emmerich for the Snowy Owl and its following update, by Brenda Swords <br>
for the Twilight Owl, as well as by Scott Graves for The Racket updating the 
tennis info and will be<br>
probably be used by our new Twilight Owl Editor, Annie Braunstein. These files 
that are created by<br>
an Adobe software package are easy to email, easy to print and have many 
advantages for use on the web.<br>
To read them a <u>free </u>Acrobat Reader can easily be downloaded from the 
Internet and&nbsp; installed on PC's and Macs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#FF0000">We shall certainly make 
sure that &quot;snail mail&quot; contacts are carefully maintained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Exciting news today is that information 
about the 2007 Art Show and entry forms <br>
will be available on the web from the web site of Rachel and John Roll. A link &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Art 
Show</font>&quot; is listed at <br>
the top of the Twilight Web Page. They already have done much to organize this 
important Twilight<br>
activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Although Twilight lives and breathes
twelve months a year with magnificent&nbsp;<br>
falls and great winter time activities, for many of us things start in the
summer.<br>
So it is with your web page. I'll leave on key items such as the email
addresses,<br>
Twilighters and their children  , 
family pictures, births <br>
weddings and deaths of 2006 and
the&nbsp;great Snowy Owl 2006 (which I'll replace with the 2007 issue<br>
when Terry produces it). There are many archival pictures of Twilighters on the web 
page now. I'd like <br>
more
and updates. The Green Book will be there in the Archival Section and will soon 
have the 2006<br>
updates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In order to make things orderly on the server where all of the&nbsp;<br>
internet information is kept, I shall take off all the old&nbsp;and archival
material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;I'll keep everything that has
appeared for the last&nbsp;six plus years<br>
on Twilight Websites (Twilight Y2k Celebration, Twilight Art Shows,&nbsp;<br>
Snowy Owls&nbsp; 2001-6,Twilight Owls 2001-6
and all&nbsp;images&nbsp;on my
computer or on CDs.&nbsp;<br>
If any of this information is needed, it can be emailed to you.<br>
<br>
There's a place for Artie Hommel, 
our hard working superintendent, whose team saved<br>
the month of July for us all after the flood of June 26,
to put information that will be useful <br>
for everyone which we'll&nbsp; have 
updated for 2007.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I plan to continue to list Mountain Top Web 
Sites. This will be helpful for checking newspaper articles, <br>
making reservations at restaurants, contacting local merchants, etc. I'd 
appreciate additions to <br>
the list, just email me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Twilight Park Archives are in several 
books, private collections, family memorabilia,<br>
Catskill mountain information, oral histories, etc. It is currently planned to 
gather some of these<br>
records and at least make an electronic listing. Last year's entry in
by Dean Davies on the origin of the <br>
Twilight clubs is a start. This is a project 
to be shared
by the whole Park and Mountain Top Community.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It remains a good policy to change
the Password to logon to the Twilight Web page from <br>
time to time. This makes 
 
information such
as email addresses a little less available to the general <br>
public. I'll always 
post the ID and Password
on the web update notice.<br>
