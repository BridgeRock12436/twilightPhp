<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dear Fellow Cottagers,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At the upcoming Annual Cottager's Meeting, the Board will ask you to consider a proposal regarding a parcel of property known as "the back 88" acres - see map).<br>The 88 acres are believed to have been acquired mainly in 1920, with a view to extending the golf course. The property begins on the Western side of Sunset Road (behind Rory's)
<br>and is more long than wide, parallel to 23A, and ends beyond the place which rents snow-mobiles in the winter and calls itself "Perfectionary Lawn Care" in the summer.
<br>These businesses belong to Tim Legg, who owns frontage on 23A, and has a right-of-way across our property to access other holdings of his on the other side of our 88 acres.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Last summer the Board received a report from the "Committee on the Future", and one of the points it made was that Mr. Legg's snow-mobile customers make frequent use of paths
<br>which go beyond the right of way, and they are more than likely the same people whose tracks can be seen crossing the golf course. Although the Board has been advised
<br>that the liability issues which the Committee on the Future envisioned are generally Mr. Legg's liabilities, the proposal now being put before the Cottagers arose from the investigation into the back 88.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We learned that about half (that which is closer to Tannersville) of the property includes a stream which flows into a reservoir owned by the City of New York.
<br>This western half also includes Mr. Legg's right-of-way. At our invitation, Arlene Weissman of the New York City DEP came to visit the property during
<br>the winter, and Nathan showed her around the property. Ms. Weissman told me that the western half of the property could be of interest, but that it is not land
<br>which would command a high price in the open market because it is difficult to access, has a lot of swampy areas, and is therefore not very attractive to potential builders.
<br>She informed me that the procedure which is followed is to formally request an appraisal of any property being offered for sale to NYC, and if the City is interested,
<br>it will engage a qualified real estate appraiser. I was separately told by a lawyer for the Open Spaces Institute, who has had many dealings with the DEP, that these appraisals are fair and impartial.
<br>This point is important, because Ms. Weissman told me that the policy is that the appraisal becomes the price, and is non-negotiable.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp On May 30, a group of Board members, with Nathan as our guide, visited the property, and we saw for ourselves that the nicest part of the land is that which is closest to us,
<br>and that the further out we went the more we became aware of abandoned (and inhabited) trailers, deforestation by neighbors (both on adjoining lands), etc.
<br>The unanimous conclusion of the Board was that if the opportunity to sell the western half of the back 88 to New York City is a possibility, then we should recommend that course to the Cottagers.
<br>Our thinking is that by making that sale, we would be exchanging a problematic neighbor with a right of way over our property for a benign neighbor (New York City),
<br>and that we could thus also raise some cash for use in the event a truly contiguous parcel of property became available for sale.
Therefore, we see advantages to selling part of the back 88,
<br>and no advantage in keeping the same part.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are several things Cottagers must bear in mind:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1.) Ms. Weissman can not guarantee that New York City DEP will be interested;
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2.) If the City does want the property, the price will not be very high estimates range from $1000 to $2000 per acre, and it is not yet clear exactly how many acres would be sold
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3.) If one is made, the offer has a time limit.  In view of this last point,
it seems to the Board that the next step would be to ask the Cottagers as a body whether they support the proposal,
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and if they do, to approach the City for an appraisal, as described above.
<br>If the Cottagers do not support the proposal, the matter ends at the Annual  Meeting.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Until May 30, no current Board member had ever visited the back 88, and an  informal poll revealed that only a handful of Cottagers ever had.
<br>It seems important that anyone who is concerned about this potential sale have an opportunity to look at the property for  themselves.  Therefore, I have asked Nathan to guide any interested persons.
<br>around the  property.  He is available on July 18 at 9am, and you should allow at least two hours to take the  walk we did.  Most of the land has no paths, and
<br>you should be prepared to cross some streams  and bogs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For the Board, 
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sincerely,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Joe Keiffer
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp President
