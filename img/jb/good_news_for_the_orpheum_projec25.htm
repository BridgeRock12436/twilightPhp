<p><font size="4">The Orpheum project is an example of a&nbsp; public/private 
partnership that New York and <br>
Greene County recognize as an important project supporting the economic 
development <br>
of the mountaintop area. About 38% of the money needed for this $4 million 
project will <br>
have come from public sources and some 62% from private donors. <br>
<br>
The Catskill Mountain Foundation expects to start work again sometime in June 
and <br>
work until completion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">And from Peter Finn:</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here are some things to pass on to donors to the Orpheum and 
others who are eagerly<br>
&nbsp;awaiting the resumption of work:<br>
<br>
Chuck&nbsp;&nbsp; Royce's&nbsp;&nbsp; $500,000 donation was contingent on our firming up the rest of the 
funding needed <br>
to complete the Orpheum.&nbsp; While Senator Seward called me right after the NY 
State budget <br>
was approved to tell me that he had obtained $500,000 for the Orpheum, the 
state's funding <br>
wasn't actually official until last week when the Senate passed a resolution 
listing the specific <br>
projects to be funded, with the amounts for each.&nbsp; Attached is a copy of the 
list of projects, <br>
listed alphabetically.&nbsp; Our funding is listed under Catskill Mountain Foundation 
- <br>
Orpheum Performing Arts Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; The funding we now have in place to complete 
the <br>
Orpheum is as follows:<br>
<br>
a.&nbsp; &nbsp; $500,000 from Senator Seward from the 2008 - 2009 NY State budget that was 
just passed,<br>
b.&nbsp; &nbsp; $500,000 from the Royce Family Foundation to be given as a match for the 
NY State funding<br>
&nbsp;just obtained,<br>
c.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just over $500,000 from the refinancing the Foundation is just completing 
with Key Bank <br>
(this is on top of $500,000 in bank funding we have already <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; invested in the Orpheum),<br>
d.&nbsp; &nbsp; Approximately $200,000 in outstanding pledges for the Orpheum<br>
e.&nbsp; &nbsp; $30,000 from the Greene County Legislature being given to the Catskill 
Mountain Foundation in <br>
2008 for the Orpheum theater, and all future grants from the Greene &nbsp; &nbsp; County 
Legislature to CMF <br>
in the future up to a total of $250,000. <br>
e.&nbsp; &nbsp; $50,000 from the NY State grant that the Hunter Foundation got for the 
Orpheum<br>
g.&nbsp; &nbsp; $7,500 of façade money that Greene County Economic Development has awarded 
to the <br>
Catskill Mountain Foundation for the Orpheum<br>
<br>
The fact that the NY State funding for the Orpheum was not finalized until last 
week (and worry <br>
that the state's precarious budget situation could cause this funding to be 
changed before it was finalized) <br>
caused a delay in our plan to commit to our subcontractors to a May start date 
for resumption of work <br>
at the Orpheum.&nbsp; We needed to know that the funds would actually be in hand to 
pay the subcontractors <br>
before we committed to them.&nbsp; While we still don't have any of the new funding 
in hand, we are expecting <br>
it shortly and are now working to book our subcontractors to start work again as 
soon as possible.&nbsp; <br>
We expect work to resume at the Orpheum at some point in June.&nbsp; <br>
