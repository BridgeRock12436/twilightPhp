AKC champion line snow white and yellow labrador retrievers-8wks and ready now!(1/20/09)<br><br>
They have been raised on<br>
an all RAW diet three generations back, so I'll teach anyone who<br>
wants to buy one how to continue the diet-not hard.  Here's some<br> 
photos-I'm a portrait photographer also, so I hope you like the<br> 
photos!  They have had two cycles of de worming medication, and you<br>  
can opt to give that to them once/year or use herbs/garlic for<br>  
maintenance.   They will be sold unvaccinated, and then I will talk<br> 
to each person  about modified vaccination which they could arrange<br> 
later, or opt to just really give the minimum, measure titer to<br>
eliminate need for boosters, also certain shots are unnecessary and I<br> 
can help steer you.  I raise puppies all natural, alternative<br>
medicine,  Reiki which I practice on them also, all raw<br>
veggies,berries,goat yoghurt,meat-usually poultry,free range and<br>
antibiotic/hormone free-which i find for under 90c/lb.  There are 6<br> 
males left - well socialized since they are constantly playing with<br>
our eight children!  They are ready to go to their new homes anytime<br>
now,starting this week.<br><br>
