Last August, Deborah Dobski saw Eamon O’Rourke’s play --The Privilege of Death or How 
Things Went !om Bad to Good --at the Gene Frankel Theater in Soho, fell in love with it, and 
wanted to help Eamon and Me and My Friends Productions receive another opportunity to 
stage this exciting multi-media work, and to perfect it. 

Peter and Sarah Finn, the founders of The Catskill Mountain Foundation in Hunter sup


ported this idea by offering the 160 seat Weisberg Theater, part of The Doctorow Center for 
the Performing 
Arts, to the troupe, 
as well as offering 
housing for a week, 
a facility in which to 
construct the set, 
the use of a 16 passenger 
van, and 
much more. The 
play will go up July 
9, 10 & 11, but we 
are still raising 
money for set construction, 
costumes 
props, and lights, 
for a rehearsal space 
in New York City, 
and for transportation. 
The team, of 
course, is working 
without remuneration.

July 9, 10 & 11 

In the brief moment between the end of life and the beginning of death, there exists a 
fragmentary realm. Here we meet a group of people --a scientist, a madwoman, a boy, 
a butcher, a spiritual seeker --who are granted a series of privileges permitting lucid memory 
and reflection. Sometimes comic, often revelatory, these lives are mused on and measured. 
Each looks deeper into his earthly sojourn, and considers the many meanings of death 
before moving on . . . but to what? 

Presented by Me and My Friends Productions --a group of unique artists from various fields 
who’ve been working together, but more importantly, who have been friends for a very long 
time --The Privilege of Death is a festival of ideas, music, theater, film, dance, puppetry, and 
art woven into a seamless narrative. Inspired by playwright/director, Eamon O’Rourke, the 
production and all its aspects evolved from constant artistic collaboration. 

The inspiration for The Privilege of Death came from the experience Eamon had watching 
his mother pass away. The moment before she passed on, she took in a deep breath that 
seemed full of life. The look on her face said she was experiencing something significant. 
Though she was entering a state which most fear their entire lives, she appeared serene and 
happy. After witnessing this, Eamon became curious about what was happening in that 
moment, and this project is an exploration of exactly that.
