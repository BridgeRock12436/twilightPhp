Friends and Fellow Cottagers:<br><br>
All Angels continues to provide much needed equipment and volunteers to assist in the Hurricane Irene clean-up efforts.<br>
We have begun to work in the community of Maplecrest, while continuing our efforts in Prattsville and Lexington.<br>
As winter approaches, needs are evolving. We are supplying more portable heaters and working with Karen Monk of the United Methodist Church to identify families who need warm winter clothes.<br>
Help with holiday meals is in the planning stages.<br><br>
Thanks to Barbara Swanson, NYSAIS (New York State Association of Independent Schools) is encouraging its member schools to raise money to help us in these efforts. Monies raised will be shared equally between All Angels and an organization in Schoharie County.<br>
Also thanks to Barbie’s efforts, Cam Hardy, chaplain of Millbrook School, a boarding school in Eastern NY is organizing a community service work crew to help in Lexington. The people of Lexington are incredibly heartened by this type of outreach.<br><br>
Nora Monaco has added several new photos to the on-line album she created to chronicle the All Angels volunteers.<br>
The special masks worn by the crew are specifically designed to filter out mold spores at the flood work sites.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br>
The Vestry and Auxiliary of the Memorial Church of All Angels<br>
Twilight Park, Haines Falls, New York<br><br>
