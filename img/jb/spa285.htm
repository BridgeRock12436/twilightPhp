As some of you may know, I am an owner of the Emerson Resort and Spa, located 1/2 an hour from Twilight Park
in Mt Tremper. As the current owner manager of the resort, I wish to invite all Twilighters to come and visit us.<br><br>

This December, for the second year in a row, two Twilight women are taking a group of friends to<br>
the Emerson, for a weekend of friendship and spa treatments. This reminded me that all Twilighters receive a 20% discount for both our Inn and Lodge rooms.<br><br>

The lodge is a wonderful family and pet friendly place, and the Inn is perfect for adults who want a quiet<br>
get-away. I hope some of you will take advantage of this discount to enjoy the Catskills this winter while your Twilight house is closed. Both Bellayre and Hunter ski mountains are within an easy drive of the Emerson.<br><br>

Our family friendly Catamount restaurant is open every<br>
day, including Sunday afternoons  during football season.<br> 

Go to our web site, www.emersonresort.com, and check out our packages. If you wish<br>
to make a reservation on line, just write that you are from Twilight Park in the comment line.<br><br>

I hope you all have a wonderful winter.  I look forward to seeing you at the Emerson.<br><br>

Thanks, Emily Fisher<br><br>
