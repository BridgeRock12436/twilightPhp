The Twilight Park Youth Activities committee is excited to launch a new website where you can order Twilight Park apparel (t shirts, golf shirts,<br>
sweatshirts, hoodies etc) and gifts (water bottles, tote bags, etc) for you and your whole family. Proceeds from the sales of these items will go<br>
towards the Youth Activities Group so that we can continue to offer fun,safe, and memorable activities for the younger generations in the Park.<br><br>

Note: there are approximately 350 different items on the site - we wanted you to be able to choose from a variety of colors, clothing styles, and<br>
logo options (you don't want to show up at the pool in the same shirt as everyone else do you?). The downside to this choice is that the site can be<br>
challenging to navigate. Please follow the navigation tips on the top of each product page. All apparel items come in a variety of colors, so click<br>
on the style/logo design you like, then select color and size after.<br><br>

A word on the history of the logo: Some of you may recognize the owl logo from a line of red Twilight Park crewneck sweatshirts in the late 1970s. 
We are not certain who designed this vintage logo but believe it was created in 1978 as we have photos of people wearing them in that year. 
This sweatshirt, along with decades of old camp t-shirts, have become collectors items that several Twilighters proudly dress their children in today, 
and we wanted to bring them back for everyone to enjoy. Lizzie O'Donnell, former camp chairwoman and camp arts & crafts instructor designed many of the old camp t-shirts by hand in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.
Lizzie carved woodcuts of the designs and then hand-pressed them onto the t-shirts individually with t-shirt paint. Her son Nick recalls that she would often pull all-nighters to make all the shirts in time for the campers. 
As you know, Lizzie O'Donnell sadly passed away this year after a long and brave battle with cancer. Her eldest son Nick has carried on her legacy, using today's modern technology, but the same passion and dedication. 
He took a 1978 sweatshirt his mother had given to his daughter before she passed, and he recreated the logo first by hand and then with the aid of photoshop, and then made it in several color variations across several colors of several apparel pieces, 
totalling 350 pieces, all created individually. After recently welcoming his second child in the midst of all this work, he, like his mother, pulled a few very late nights to pull this off.<br><br>
THANK YOU LIZZIE for creating this legacy and THANK YOU NICK for continuing it.<br>
With that said, shop away friends!!
