&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Park has purchased two way radios for better communications. 
<br>
The gatehouse, pool and myself have one. If there is an urgent need to be in contact with me in the
<br>
daytime, please call the pool (589-6353) or gatehouse (589-5820) and they should be able to reach me.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp On an unrelated note, we are planning to remove old metal water lines as time permits. 
<br>If there are any behind your cottage which you want to remind me about,
please let me know.
<br>
