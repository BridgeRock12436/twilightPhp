Dear Justine, Artie, Nathan and family,<br><br>
Please accept my deepest feelings of loss and sorry for each member of your family with Hillard’s passing.<br>
As you surely know, Hillard will live-on in loving memory and with the deep respect of hundreds upon hundreds<br>
of people across this country and in lands far from our shores.<br>Hillard occupied a special place in the lives of so many for so long – few of us can have that testament to our lives.<br><br>  
The fond memories of all that Hillard did for Twilight Park are forever etched in the minds of those of us who worked with Hillard over the years.
It was Hillard’s quiet strength and sense of purpose that elevated him above all the noise and confusion that ninety closely knit families can stir-up and think important at the moment – Hillard simply moved forward among it all.  Hillard will be remembered as that person who quietly transformed what was, in some ways, a place in desperate need of repair to a place of stored beauty that renews each of us when we pass over the bridge.  We are all grateful that Artie embraced, and that Nathan now embraces, that same sense of purpose that endeared so many to their father.<br><br>   
On a very personal side, regardless of how often Hillard was upset  with me, I hope he always knew deep down how much I respected him and wanted very much to be considered his friend and colleague – being considered a friend by Hillard Hommel was a thing of pride for me personally.
Please know that the prayers of many, especially my prayers, are with you these difficult days.  We must also rejoice that Hillard is now in a place of rest and everlasting peace until you are again at his side.<br><br>
If you listen real carefully this morning you may hear Hillard’s name being put forth in remembrance from within a beautiful small stone church in the mountains of West Virginia – my prayers for Hillard, and for all of us that will miss him, will echo from this little church throughout these WV mountains and beyond.   
With deepest affection,<br><br>
Ron<br>
