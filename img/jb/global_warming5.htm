Warming (Addendum to August 3, 2007 Twilight Club II Panel Discussion)</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans" size="4">On August 3, 2007 a panel discussion on 
Global Warming was held by the Twilight Club II.<br>
The highlights of the discussions of the meeting are recorded in the August 31 
issue<br>
of the Twilight Owl which can be seen on this web site (</font><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><a href="images/TwilightOwlWebSep1.pdf">images/TwilightOwlWebSep1.pdf</a>).</font></p>

<h1>Global Warming </h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial">(Opening 
Remarks)</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:9.0pt"><font size="4">I face two 
challenges this evening.&nbsp; The first is to try to tell you something that you may 
not have heard elsewhere.&nbsp; The second is to give an overview of Global Warming 
in about 10 minutes.&nbsp; To attempt something new, I will try, and probably not 
completely successfully, to differ from most pundits by presenting issues 
without arguing strongly from a particular single view on any issue.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;In the 10 minutes, I will limit myself to 
only addressing three considerations ; i.e. scientific, economic and political 
perspectives.&nbsp; If the there is time at the end, I might summarize with a fourth 
perspective.&nbsp; </font></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Scientific Perspective:</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">&nbsp; Two facts are abundantly clear about 
Global Warming, and some are not.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First: especially since the industrial 
revolution and too a considerably larger extent in recent decades, mankind has 
added gases to the atmosphere that let in more solar heat than is radiated 
outwards – this is the Greenhouse effect .</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly: There is Global Warming and 
increasingly so in recent decades, except for some of the period from 1940 to 
the 1970’s when in fact there was Global Cooling.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is not so clear is to what extent 
there is a the cause and effect relationship between these two facts.&nbsp; In 
particular, it is not possible to relate small scale effects, such as Katrina, 
to an increase in greenhouse gases.&nbsp; However for large scale effects, 
particularly rises in average global temperature, melting ice caps and glaciers, 
and increases in sea level, it is easier to argue and to some extent measure 
relationships. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4"> The problem here is that nature, on its 
own, produces much larger effects that are not completely understood and which 
may or may not be acting right now to either increase or decrease Global 
Warming.&nbsp; After all we are coming out of a major Ice Age which left several 
miles of ice directly above us.&nbsp; After hundreds of thousands of years, this 
ended only about 10,000 years ago.&nbsp; Smaller cooling effects from a so-called 
“Little Ice Age” date back to the middle ages.&nbsp; In 1780 you could walk on ice 
from Manhattan to Staten Island. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The risks of error though are 
significant.&nbsp; Climatology is a poorly understood science and is based largely on 
models that take in average events.&nbsp; Severe events however are highly 
non-linear, i.e. they can be initiated by relatively small effects.&nbsp; This is 
sometimes known as the butterfly effect; where a butterfly’s wings in Australia 
produce minor perturbations that are enhanced and felt as tornados in the middle 
West – although, admittedly, this is somewhat of an exaggeration.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, at least as I see it, is 
not that Climatology is an exact science that predicts disastrous consequences, 
but that Climatology is an inexact science that can warn of severe risks but not 
predict actual consequences. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Economic Perspective:</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<font size="4"> Several years ago, I read an article 
trying to forecast what technologies would bring enhanced TV signals, such as 
hundreds of channels, into peoples homes.&nbsp; There were many arguments presented 
about various technologies; cable, satellite, wireless, high flying balloons, 
and so forth.&nbsp; The conclusion of the article was that the result would not be 
driven by the best technology, but rather that it would depend upon who would 
invest the billions of dollars necessary to provide a service.&nbsp; And, I think you 
can observe that this has come true.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly for energy production.&nbsp; I 
believe that if nuclear power had turned out to be as cheap as once forecasted, 
this would now be the dominant supply for all our energy needs.&nbsp; We would not 
have an oil or coal problem today, nor would we be at war in Iraq for that 
matter – but that’s getting way off the topic, and there would be other problems 
instead. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Political Perspective: </h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4">Most of the political noise on the 
subject tends, unfortunately, to be strongly driven by local parochial issues.&nbsp; 
One senator will argue how critical it is to have more subsidies and regulations 
for more production; another for more subsidies and regulations for more 
conservation.&nbsp; Rarely will you see a politician argue that both are necessary, 
and our current political environment is not much given towards useful 
compromise, particularly on these issues.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments based on free enterprise 
considerations, with some onerous Government regulations and generous subsidies 
thrown in here and there, tend to dominate.&nbsp; After all, this has proven 
fantastically successful in bringing the economic blessings we enjoy today.&nbsp; 
However this approach depends on marketplace solutions driven by costs and 
prices for those immediately effected by an economic good. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Political action needs to be global - 
and this is both difficult and rare.&nbsp; Twice in the last century, for short 
periods, the nations of the world did come together to address common issues.&nbsp; 
But, it took the calamities of two World Wars to accomplish it.&nbsp; Perhaps another 
calamity, might initiate such a coming together again.&nbsp; The volcanoes leading to 
1816, “The year New England had no summer”, or the Krakatoa volcano in 1883, 
come to mind although these are unrelated to warming.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there do seem to be some 
strong leaders today who are particularly concerned about the social issues.&nbsp; 
However, this seems to come mostly from leaders after they have any formal 
political&nbsp; power.&nbsp; In this regard, I would not be totally surprised if even 
George Bush, when he is no longer in office, will want to enhance his image and 
join in this crusade. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4"> In addition to the Scientific, Economic 
and Political perspectives, there is another dimension – in fact, the one with 
which Al Gore concludes his presentations. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Moral Perspective:</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<font size="4">&nbsp; There are several types of moral 
questions that can be raised:</font></p>
<p class="b2" style="margin-left: 27.35pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<span style="font-family: Symbol"><font size="4">·</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span></span><font size="4">In that the Lord God has given man dominion 
over land, and sea and all therein, what are our responsibilities ?</font></p>
<p class="b2" style="margin-left: 27.35pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<span style="font-family: Symbol"><font size="4">·</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span></span><font size="4">More pressing, what is our responsibility 
toward the human condition of billions of other people ?</font></p>
<p class="b2" style="margin-left: 27.35pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 6.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<span style="font-family: Symbol"><font size="4">·</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span></span><font size="4">More immediate, what do we leave for our 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren ? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a moral scale these questions can be 
given answers ranging from “feel-good” responses of things that are nice to do, 
to fundamental issues of the power of good and evil in our lives and, as one 
panelist put it,&nbsp; “damage to the soul”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a concluding question would be – 
Where on this scale do you put the issues of Global Warming ? </font></p>
