Friends and Fellow Cottagers:<br><br>
As the accompanying gallery of photos shows, All Angels is continuing to provide a flow of supplies that are essential to our neighbor’s efforts to dig their way out of the mud and debris left by Hurricane Irene. Since the last report, additional dehumidifiers, Shop-Vacs, box fans, shop lights, ladders, cleaning supplies and portable generators have been delivered to Lexington and Prattsville by All Angels volunteers. In the near future we hope to be expanding our efforts to include Maplecrest.<br><br>
On Saturday, October 8, a volunteer work crew will be going from Twilight to help in the clean-up at the Lexington Methodist Church.<br><br>
If you’re interested in pitching in, please contact either Jim Martocci or Barbie Swanson. Appropriately rated work masks will be provided all volunteers.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br>
The Vestry and Auxiliary of the Memorial Church of All Angels<br>
Twilight Park, Haines Falls, New York<br><br>
