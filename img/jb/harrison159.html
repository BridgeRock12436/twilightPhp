<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We are beyond thrilled!  While we've been waiting for the paperwork to finalize back<br>
and forth across AZ and CA, we've been staying in a quiet Scottsdale hotel with baby, <br>
equipped with a kitchen and very comfy for our new Decker family member.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Today, Thanksgiving Day, Kari and I will be driving back to California with our precious cargo.<br>
It will be the most wonderful Thanksgiving Day we have ever had. This has all happened<br>
so fast we are really still in a bit of disbelief.<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We have so much to be thankful for, a new baby, the love of each other,<br>
our wonderful family and friends, our health, our country.  Bless you all this Thanksgiving!<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We look forward to introducing Harrison to the Twilight community.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Love,
<br>
<br>
John, Kari & Harrison
