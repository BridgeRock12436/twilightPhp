<p>&quot;We are creating a community in which the interests of each are the concern 
of all. Our scheme is based not upon ideal human nature, but on human nature as 
it is, taking enlightened self-interest as the cornerstone, and for the pillars 
of our structure the love of home, the love of children, and the desire for 
wholesome recreation, the need of rest and refreshment for tired city residents 
and the enjoyment which comes from simple comfort, congenial society, and 
beautiful surroundings.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594573">Introduction to the Green Book - 2005</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>Since it has not been updated for a number of years, Jean Barish Sterrett and 
others have prepared this revision of the Twilight Park Green Book. It was 
approved by the Board of Directors at their July 2, 2005 meeting. In addition to 
a hard-copy distribution, it is posted on the Twilight Park Website (www.TwilightPark.com).
</p>
<p>The Twilight Park Green Book is intended to provide both as an introduction 
for newcomers and a reference for members. Its purpose is to outline services, 
rules and policies applicable to the members and visitors to Twilight Park. The 
relationship of the Green Book to other sources of information is more fully 
described in the section on Governance. This Green Book is an evolving document 
and an attempt will be made to provide you with new pages as changes are made.</p>
<p>Because changes in rules and polices are frequently made in response to 
changing circumstances, it is impractical to keep the hard-copy version 
currently updated. Consequently, the official and authoritative version of the 
Green Book is the Website version.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594574">Importance of Volunteers</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>Much of the actual work of providing the support, the many services and 
activities, and the functioning of Twilight Park is done by volunteers. For the 
well-being of the Park, it is vital that Cottagers volunteer to undertake 
activities designed to enhance community life and are willing to serve on 
committees and the like. All are urged, encouraged, and even expected to 
participate in whatever form most suits their talents.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594575">A Short History of Twilight Park</a>
</p>
</b></font>
<p>Twilight Park has its roots in the &quot;Twilight Club&quot; founded in New York in 
1883 as a dinner and discussion group. The club still exists, in a somewhat 
modified form, but no longer has any connection to Twilight Park.</p>
<p>Charles Wingate, the founder of the Twilight Club, was also the founder of 
Twilight Park. A &quot;sheep pasture&quot; to the south of the falls was purchased for $10 
an acre in 1887 to establish a summer community for club members. The Twilight 
Park Association was formed in 1888. Similar communities were formed about this 
time in Onteora and Elka Park. </p>
<p>By 1890 there were 30 cottages. Several inns were built, and some rebuilt 
when they burned down. Only Santa Cruz Inn remains as the present Pratt cottage. 
A tennis court was built in 1889&nbsp;and a tennis building added in 1890, to include 
four bowling alleys and a pool table. The golf course was also added in 1889 and 
the swimming pool in 1921. The present Clubhouse is from 1932. Hikers joined the 
&quot;Lingernots&quot; and could earn a diploma in Latin as Doctor of Pedistry by walking 
300 miles and climbing 20 mountains in a single season. Churches built in 
Twilight include St. Paul’s in 1891, the Union Chapel in 1897 and the present 
All Angels in 1896.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594576">Governance</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twilight Park is a community more than one hundred years old that is governed 
by a variety of rules and traditions. Chief among these are the Lease Agreement, 
the By-laws, and rules established by the members at the Annual Meeting and the 
Board as set forth in this Green Book.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594577">Lease Agreement</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>The Lease Agreement provides for certain contractual rights, privileges, 
responsibilities and obligations between Cottagers and the Park. There have been 
many amendments to this agreement over the years, so one Cottager’s agreement 
may vary slightly from a neighbor’s. All Leases provide that Cottagers shall be 
bound by rules established by the Park and its Board of Directors. </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594578">By-laws</a> </p>
</b></font>
<p>The By-laws contain the basic procedures for the governance of the Park by a 
Board of Directors. Directors are elected for up to two three-year terms. They 
in turn elect a President and Vice-President from among their members, and also 
a Secretary, Treasurer, and Assistant Treasurer, who do not need to be members 
of the Board. </p>
<p>The Board manages the affairs of the Park including fixing assessments, 
making and enforcing rules for conduct and admission to membership in the Park. 
Board members represent Cottagers’ interests and are available to discuss any 
issues or concerns. </p>
<p>Under the By-laws, the Board has established a number of committees. The 
largest and most prominent of these is the Activities Committee, which, through 
its many sub-committees, sponsors the great variety of activities that we all 
enjoy. Many of the policies stated here were first developed by the respective 
committees and then approved by the Board.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594579">Annual Meeting</a> </p>
</b></font>
<p>On the first Saturday in August, the Annual Cottagers Meeting is held for the 
election of directors and such other business as may come before the membership. 
While not required by Park rules or the By-laws, as a matter of practice the 
annual budget for the next calendar year is approved and individual committee 
reports are presented.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594580">Green Book</a> </p>
</b></font>
<p>This Green Book sets forth Park rules approved by the members at the Annual 
Meeting and by the Board and provides a handy guide for new and old Cottagers. 
It is supplemented by the annual calendar, which contains not only a calendar of 
meetings and activities but also considerable information on members, maps, 
committees and local services. Additional information is available in the Owl, 
which is published during the summer, the Snowy Owl, published during the 
Spring, and on the Twilight Park Website. </p>

</b></font><b>
<p>SUPERVISION</b> – The Superintendent looks out for your property when you are 
not in Twilight. It is important to notify him of your arrival and departure 
times and to leave your cottage securely locked when you are away. He must be 
informed if the cottage is to be used by others – adult children, family or 
friends. He must have <u>two</u> keys to your cottage. One is for his own use 
and the other is to be used, only when you have given permission, by 
housekeepers or workmen needing access. The Superintendent must be notified if 
your lock is changed.</p>
<b>
<p>WATER</b> - Usually turned on about May 15 and turned off about October 15. 
The Association is responsible for &quot;delivering&quot; water to your house, but hook-up 
and draining of the plumbing must be arranged by you with a local plumber.</p>
<b>
<p>SEWER</b> – The Park Sewage Disposal System also operates from about May 15 
to October 15. To keep the facility working and to avoid costly repairs it is <u>
imperative</u> that you do not discard non-biologically degradable materials 
such as plastics, cotton, glass or metallic items into the sewer.</p>
<p>Cottagers planning off-season use (October 15 to May 15) should refer to the 
Winter Use guidelines on page 13 and to the paragraph on well drilling and 
individual winter sewer systems on page 9.</p>
<b>
<p>GARBAGE</b> – From about May 15 to October 15, the garbage collector is under 
contract to the Park to pick up household trash and garbage from each cottage 
without charge to the Cottagers. For the first month the garbage is picked up 
only on Tuesdays. For the last two weeks in June until the first Tuesday in 
September, the garbage is picked up on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Starting with the 
first Tuesday in September until the third Tuesday in October, the garbage is 
picked up only on Tuesdays. Each Cottager is entitled to the pickup of one load 
of burnable lawn refuse each year (it does not have to be on Earth Day). During 
the rest of the year, all collection is at the Cottager’s expense. </p>
<p>A few simple rules:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Place refuse in securely tied sturdy plastic bags and store bags for 
    pick-up (preferably in a raccoon- and bear-proof shed or container) near 
    your cottage, not on the road.</p>
    <p>To conform to the Waste Recycling Program, newspapers, corrugated 
    cardboard, glass bottles and certain plastic containers must be separated 
    for collection.</p>
    <p>For off-season collection and the pick-up of large or unusual items or 
    more details on recycling, contact Bruce Feml (589-6155).</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>DUMPING</b> – Disposal of garbage, brush or tree cuttings, or any other form 
of rubbish within the Park is strictly prohibited. Arrangements to dispose of 
garbage and rubbish can be made through Bruce Feml. The firm employed to cut 
brush or trees should remove the cuttings. As a special one-time service each 
year, the Park truck will pick up and dispose of one load of brush cuttings, 
dead branches and other such outdoor rubbish if it is piled neatly by the side 
of the road.</p>
<b>
<p>LABOR</b> – Requests for work by Park employees (such as wood delivery, 
mowing, spring clean-ups, etc.) must be made to the Superintendent.</p>
<b>
<p>FIREWOOD</b> – May be ordered from the Superintendent. No Saturday or Sunday 
deliveries. Winter needs must be ordered by November 1.</p>
<b>
<p>AUTOMATIC GATES</b> – The gates are operated by codes punched in on the 
keypad. Codes may be obtained from the Real Estate Representative.</p>
<b>
<p>GATEHOUSE</b> – Please notify the person staffing the gatehouse of expected 
guests (589-5820) or ask guests to call your cottage from the gatehouse.</p>
<b>
<p>INTRA-PARK MAIL</b> – May be delivered to and collected from the gatehouse’s 
gatekeeper from July 1 through Labor Day. During the off-season, mail is 
distributed in the winter mailboxes in the Superintendent’s outer office. All 
winter mail not picked up as of July 1 is transferred to the gatehouse 
mailboxes.</p>
<b>
<p>PARK CALENDAR</b> – Lists upcoming events of the season, emergency and 
commercial telephone numbers as well as phone numbers of Cottagers and Park 
buildings. Calendars are made available on Earth Day or can be obtained at the 
Superintendent’s office.</p>
<b>
<p>DAY CAMP</b> – Children of Cottagers, renters, guests are welcome. For 
information, contact the Camp Committee Chairperson. Applications are mailed in 
the Spring.</p>
<b>
<p>TENNIS</b> – Courts are available to Twilighters and their guests on a 
first-come basis with the teaching court the province of the pro<font COLOR="#00007f">.</font> 
On weekends and holidays, tennis whites are required, children must defer to 
adults and players are asked not to play longer than an hour if others are 
waiting. Appropriate tennis wear, including tennis shoes, is required at all 
times. Lowered nets may be raised <u>only</u> by permission of the Tennis 
Chairperson or the Superintendent. Additional rules and regulations are 
developed by the Tennis Committee and posted at the courts.</p>
<b>
<p>SWIMMING POOL</b> – Please introduce your family and guests to the lifeguards 
and familiarize yourself with the pool’s safety rules. Children under eleven 
must be accompanied by an adult. Schedule of hours when the pool is open and the 
lifeguard on duty is posted at the Gatehouse and Pool House. Additional rules 
and regulations are developed by the Swimming Pool Committee and posted at the 
pool.</p>
<b>
<p>FISHING</b> – Fishing may be available at the reservoir. It is occasionally 
stocked with trout for the Park community, so please limit your catch.</p>
<b>
<p>HIKING</b> – Speak to the Chairperson of the Linger-Not Society for 
information and suggestions about trails and scenic trips.</p>
<b>
<p>PARK SERVICES</b> – Lawn services, cleaning of gutters, shoveling of paths, 
plowing of driveways, etc., are available upon request to the Superintendent at 
hourly rates.</p>
<b>
<p>WEB SITE</b> – The Webmaster maintains a website for use by Twilight Park 
members. Items of general interest are posted regularly. Contact the Webmaster 
if you have information that may be appropriate and it will be posted for you. A 
logon name and password is necessary to access the site. Please be careful to 
see that these are not made distributed to anyone except Park members and their 
family members.</p>
<b>
<p>DIRECTORY</b> – Also on the Web is a directory for members and families. 
Information posted there is the source for a variety of uses, including billing, 
the annual Holiday address list, e-mail notices and the Park calendar. Under the 
Reports / E-mail Reports pages is an &quot;EMAIL ALL&quot; facility to send a message to 
all those listed in the directory. Guidelines for appropriate usage of this 
facility are included there. A separate User Id and Logon is needed to access 
the directory. You can also use the site to maintain entries for you and your 
family members. </p>

  <p>(The following two paragraph policy statement was approved at the Annual<br>
  Cottagers Meeting on August 5, 2006.)</p>
</dir>
<b>
<p>RULES AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT</b> - Below, and throughout the Greenbook, there 
are a number of Park rules that have been adopted from time to time by the 
Membership or the Board of Directors. There are also rules in the lease. As 
noted in the Governance section, the lease provides that all Cottagers are bound 
by rules established by the Park or its Board of Directors. Each 
leaseholder/cottager shall be responsible for the actions of members of their 
families, guests and invitees for compliance with all of the rules and 
regulations of Twilight Park whether or not in active residence in Twilight 
Park. While the rules below do not provide for enforcement remedies, the Board 
of Directors has the authority to impose such remedies as it determines 
appropriate. For most of these rules, enforcement is carried out simply by 
asking those who have breached them to do so no longer. For more serious 
infractions, more material remedies may be imposed.</p>
<p>The lease provides in part that &quot;No disorderly or disreputable persons shall 
be allowed to occupy the demised premises or any part thereof.&quot; Disorderly 
behavior includes any conduct which endangers or is injurious to the welfare of 
other leaseholders, cottagers, members of their family, guests or invitees or to 
property situated in Twilight Park. A violation of this proscription against 
disorderly behavior shall be subject to disciplinary action as determined by the 
Board of Directors. Such disciplinary action may include:</p>
<dir>

</dir>
<b>
<p>SPEED LIMIT</b> – 20 miles an hour – or less if driving conditions warrant. 
Children playing or bicycling, walkers enjoying Twilight’s natural beauty or 
just stopping to chat always have the right of way in the Park! So please obey 
&quot;One Way,&quot; &quot;Slow&quot; and &quot;No Parking&quot; signs. When parking your car, remember the 
roads <u>must</u> be kept clear in case of fire or other emergency. <i>Please 
ask your guests to follow these rules.</p>
</i><b>
<p>VEHICLES</b> – The roads and land within Twilight are private, but we require 
that any motorized vehicle (including motorbikes and motorcycles) bear an 
effective license plate and be operated by a properly licensed driver. Except 
for the dirt road along the creek, all motor vehicles, except Park maintenance 
vehicles, are banned from the golf course year round.</p>
<b>
<p>RENTALS AND SALES</b> – Must be negotiated through the official Board Real 
Estate Representative, as outlined in the Real Estate Procedures and Membership 
sections.</p>
<b>
<p>WELL-DRILLING AND INDIVIDUAL WINTER SEWER SYSTEMS</b> – This may include the 
short-term use of a chemical toilet as outlined on page 13. The installation of 
long term facilities requires Board approval, based on a satisfactory 
engineering survey and the issuance of a Health Department permit (generally 
limited to off-season use only). Please discuss with the Superintendent or the 
chair of the Water and Sewer Committee <u>before</u> undertaking site evaluation 
or construction.</p>
<b>
<p>CONSTRUCTION AND EXTERNAL RENOVATION</b> – As stated in the By-Laws, to 
preserve and protect the natural beauty and character of Twilight Park, plans 
for new buildings or any alterations to existing buildings and other changes to 
cottages, property and landscaping must be approved by the Board or the Design 
Review Committee before work is begun. </p>
<p>For additional information on when and how to obtain approval, see the 
Changes to Cottages and Property section of this handbook.</p>
<p>Contractors working on your property must abide by the following rules: </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Work may not begin before 8 a.m. on weekdays during July and August; and
    </p>
    <p>No work may be done on weekends during July and August or on Memorial and 
    Labor Day weekends.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The Board also works through the Design Review Committee to correct 
unpleasant sights and sounds which may occur in the Park – unconcealed garbage 
cans, visible clotheslines, towels and sleeping bags on railings, dead branches, 
toys or bicycles left on the road – and unnecessary noise. To obviate the need 
for any action, we simply ask every Cottager to always be considerate of his or 
her neighbors in the time-honored Twilight way.</p>
<b>
<p>CLUBHOUSE</b> – For adult casual use of the Clubhouse (requires at least one 
adult over 21 for supervision), such as watching television in the Lounge or 
using the Xerox machine, keys can be obtained from the key box in the 
Superintendent’s outer office. Before taking the keys, the user must sign the 
sign-out sheet. In leaving the Clubhouse, all lights must be turned off and 
doors locked and the keys must be returned to key box in the Superintendent’s 
outer office. Children should not be allowed to roam behind the stage, in the 
kitchen area or in the loft. Everyone should be out of the Clubhouse by 10 p.m. 
Exceptions will be granted by the Clubhouse Chair (whose identity is set out in 
the Calendar under Activities Committees) in special circumstances. If a 
Cottager would like to use the Clubhouse for a private event, s/he should 
contact the Clubhouse Chair at least one month before the event to find out 
about reserving the space, possible fees, insurance requirements and disallowed 
activities that can&nbsp;subject the Park to liability claims.</p>
<b>
<p>FIRE</b> – Always be cautious. For your protection a good-sized fire 
extinguisher is suggested – preferably a five-pound dry chemical type, to resist 
freezing in winter. It should be readily available and your household instructed 
in its proper use. Each fire extinguisher should be checked each year and 
refreshed per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Formulating an effective plan 
for leaving your cottage in case of fire is a wise precaution. Burning of <u>
anything</u> – leaves, brush or trash – is prohibited. </p>
<p>Smoke detectors are <u>strongly</u> recommended on every floor and in every 
bedroom.</p>
<b>
<p>CAMPFIRES – </b>Campfires, holiday bonfires and cookouts are not permitted in 
the Park, except at Wingate Field and on the old golf course. Permission of the 
Park superintendent is required and only designated areas are to be used for 
such fires. </p>
<b>
<p>CHIMNEYS</b> – Should be cleaned at least once a year.</p>
<strong>
<p>FIREARMS &amp; FIREWORKS</strong>&nbsp;– Hunting or discharging of any kind of any 
firearm is strictly prohibited anywhere in Twilight.&nbsp; Similarly, any use of 
fireworks, other than sparklers,&nbsp;is prohibited within the Park, except as may be 
authorized for celebrations by the Board of Directors. </p>
<strong>
<p>HAINES FALLS&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>The falls at the entrance to the Park has been the 
site of tragic accidents.&nbsp; Walking anywhere below the bridge or near the 
falls is strictly forbidden.&nbsp; Cottagers are&nbsp;to request anyone found&nbsp;there 
to leave. This restriction applies to Cottagers and their guests. If they fail 
to leave, the Superintendent should be notified, and if he is not available, the 
State Police.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p>DOGS</b> – Dogs should be kept under control at all times and are not 
permitted at the swimming pool, tennis courts or in the upper reservoir. Dogs 
roaming loose should be reported to the Board. Owners will receive notice of a 
$10 fine along with their property bill. For repeated, or more serious 
offenders, a fine of $50 will be levied. Also, Cottagers should be considerate 
of barking by their dogs, especially when this barking occurs when the dogs are 
left alone, and the owners may not be sufficiently aware of the nuisance caused 
for their neighbors. Dogs may run free at the old golf course, but must be under 
the control of their masters.</p>
<b>
<p>OFF-SEASON </b>– See Winter Use.</p>
<b>
<p>CLOSING THE COTTAGE</b> – The following procedures are suggested:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <p>Water – Make arrangements with your plumber before you leave and 
          inform him of washers, dishwashers, etc., which should be serviced, in 
          addition to disconnecting and draining your plumbing.</p>
          <p>Sewer – Be sure your plumber knows the sewer system does not 
          operate after mid-October.</p>
          <p>Gas – It is recommended that your gas supply be turned off at the 
          tanks.</p>
          <p>Electric – Turn off the main electric power switch and notify the 
          power company, if needed.</p>
          <p>Phone – Service can be temporarily discontinued.</p>
          <p>Lock–up – Check all doors and windows carefully and notify the 
          Superintendent of your departure.</p>

<b>
<p>BEARS -&nbsp; </b>Roaming bears can be a hazard in the Park.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Procedures promulgated <br>
by the New York State Department of Environment Protection should be followed.&nbsp;
<br>
In particular, the feeding of bears is illegal. Also prohibited is the use of
<br>
outdoor bird feeders with bird seed.&nbsp; Currently, these are specifically <br>
prohibited in the Park.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594583">Changes to Cottages and Property</a>
</p>
</b></font>
<p>Twilight has a Design Review Committee to help maintain the beauty of the 
Park. Cottagers wishing to make changes to the exterior of their cottages or 
leaseholds must first receive written permission from the Design Review 
Committee. In accordance with the By-laws, all new buildings or additions to 
existing buildings must be approved by the Board, on recommendation by the 
Design Review Committee, before work can begin.</p>
<p>The changes to cottages or property that require approval include:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>New buildings</p>
    <p>Additions and exterior renovations to existing buildings</p>
    <p>Changes to color of exterior painting</p>
    <p>Window renovations</p>
    <p>Tree removal &gt; 8 inches in diameter (including dead and dying trees). 
    Tree cutting that is noisy during July and August and the Memorial and Labor 
    Day Weekends is subject to the same time-restriction rules (set out on page 
    9) as contractors working on your property.</p>
    <p>Driveways</p>
    <p>Landscape lighting and major exterior lighting</p>
    <p>Sewage system changes</p>
    <p>Major landscaping that would alter the view from Park lands and 
    neighboring cottages</p>
    <p>Other changes to cottages or cottage land that could affect the character 
    of the Park (if there is any question, please contact a member of the Design 
    Review Committee to discuss whether approval is required).</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The steps to be taken to secure approval from the Committee:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Complete an Application form which can be obtained from the 
    Superintendent. When applicable, plans or sketches, color samples or 
    brochures of products must also be submitted. </p>
    <p>Contact a member of the Design Review Committee and all neighbors within 
    sight of the property and forward copies of plans to all.</p>
    <p>Review plans (for construction use architectural renderings and plans, to 
    scale) and conduct walk-throughs as necessary to secure written approval 
    first from all neighbors, followed by written approval from the Design 
    Review Committee. In cases where a neighbor objects, the Cottager and 
    neighbor should do everything reasonable to reach a compromise. (In rare 
    cases, the Design Review Committee may give approval without full neighbor 
    consent.)</p>
    <p>Forward completed form (including all plans, written comments and 
    approvals) to:</p>
    <dir>
      <p>The Board of Directors – for new and major construction. The Board will 
      forward to Superintendent.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594584">Winter Use</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>The occupancy of cottages during the off season* is limited to those cottages 
suitably equipped with acceptable sewer disposal facilities (as approved by the 
Board). Unauthorized occupancy of cottages shall be subject to administrative 
punitive action including fines of $100 for the first night and $200 per night 
thereafter. This board resolution is to protect the Park sewer system and 
possible loss of the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) 
permit.</p>
<p>*Usually October 15<sup>th</sup> to May 15<sup>th</sup>, or as set annually 
by the Board.</p>
<p>Cottagers contemplating winter use may meet the requirements for a 
satisfactory sewage treatment facility by a number of different systems which 
have been approved by the Board on recommendation from the Chair of the Water 
and Sewer Committee. They include chemical toilets, electrical toilets, aerobic 
systems with dedicated sewer lines, holding tanks and other such systems. Please 
be advised that the system must be approved <b>in advance of occupancy</b> by 
the Superintendent who will supply information about the requirements of any 
particular system. </p>
<p>In addition to sewage disposal, there are a number of other considerations to 
bear in mind for winter use of cottages in Twilight. The following Winter Rules 
apply:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>If you need parking, advance notification is required since this cannot 
    be done after the snow is piled deep. You cannot park in the roads, so 
    clearing a space is essential.</p>
    <p>Please let the Superintendent know by telephone, letter or e-mail 
    (address found in the Calendar on the page with telephone listings) in 
    advance of every intended use of your cottage. If use is to be by friends, 
    children or family, notification must be given by letter and specific dates 
    should be stated. And for your own convenience, a telephone call to him 
    requesting snow and weather conditions can save you considerable trouble.
    </p>
    <p>When you arrive in the Park, blow your horn as you go by the 
    Superintendent’s cottage regardless of the time of day or night.</p>
    <p>All secondary roads – Church, Barkeloo and Pharmacy Hill - will be closed 
    throughout the winter. It is also possible that the automatic gate will be 
    out of service from time to time.</p>
    <p>If you are in the Park and observe any person on the Falls, you must 
    require that they leave at once. This restriction applies to Cottagers and 
    their guests as well. Should the person refuse to leave, the Superintendent 
    should be called, and if he is not available, the State Police. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The following hints may be helpful:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Use snow tires. You may need chains and sand to reach the upper level. 
    Please remember that the Superintendent is not expected to pull you out when 
    stuck. If you get stuck, call Haines Falls Auto Towing: 589-6181.</p>
    <p>Continual use of fireplaces and wood stoves increase the danger of 
    chimney fires. Be sure yours are clean and in good condition.</p>
    <p>There is no free trash pickup service off season. Please make your own 
    arrangements with Bruce Feml: 589-6155.</p>
    <p>Please place orders for firewood before November 1, partly because of the 
    possibility of snow, after which the work crews are no longer available to 
    deliver wood.</p>
    <p>For the various reasons listed above, deliveries of furniture, 
    appliances, etc., should not be made between November 1 and May 1.</p>
    <p>Please keep your brush and other clippings away from your cottage and 
    particularly away from road culverts. This measure will keep run-off water 
    flowing properly and will prevent diversion of water with damage to roads 
    and to your property. Please notify the Superintendent of any large amounts 
    of brush so that he can make arrangements for disposal for which you will be 
    billed.</p>
    <p>Park water lines are cleansed with a chlorine solution each Spring. 
    Please clear the water lines in your cottage before using the water within 
    the system for the first time each season.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Please observe these suggestions and recommendations on sewage and winter 
use. This will enable the Park to prevent damage and keep our (your) maintenance 
costs down.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594585">Annual Assessment</a> </p>
</b></font>
<p>The expenditures made to operate and maintain the Park’s facilities are 
funded by an annual assessment charged to each cottage. The assessment amount is 
determined by the Board of Directors. It covers a calendar year (with 
installments payable on the first day of February, May, August and November) and 
has three components: property charge, operating assessment and capital 
contribution.</p>
<p>The <u>property</u> portion of the assessment represents the lease payment 
for the lots associated with each cottage. The current charge is a $50 minimum 
payment on the first lot and then $10 per additional lot per year and, 
accordingly, the aggregate lease payment varies from cottage to cottage. The 
range of payments is from the $50 minimum to approximately $150 per cottage per 
year. This charge is made once a year and appears on the first bill of the year 
(February). </p>
<p>The <u>operating</u> portion of the assessment covers the routine cost of 
running and maintaining the Park. These expenditures include salaries of Park 
personnel, maintenance of grounds, buildings and equipment, activities (pool, 
tennis, etc.) and general expenses such as property taxes, insurance, garbage 
removal, etc.</p>
<p>The <u>capital</u> portion of the assessment is used to fund the cost of new 
equipment or major enhancements to Park structures and facilities. Such 
expenditures, because of their magnitude, are capitalized and depreciated over a 
number of years rather than expensed in a single year. Recent examples of such 
expenditures are the upgraded water system; improvements to the Clubhouse 
facilities; and the purchase of a new dump truck.</p>
<p>Assessment payments are due quarterly on the 1<sup>st</sup> of the month as 
stated on the bill. A penalty equal to 10% of any quarterly amount due is 
automatically charged if payment is not received within two months of the due 
date. We regret that Park water and sewer service cannot be restored to the 
cottage until all delinquent bills and fine are paid in full.</p>

  </dir>

</u>
<p>Twilight Park is an historic community and we seek to preserve those aspects 
of architectural environment that contribute to our unique character, heritage 
and special qualities. To achieve this objective, the Design and Review 
Committee reviews proposal on a case-by-case basis. The following architectural 
Guidelines have been created for those who wish to build within Twilight Park</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font SIZE="4"><b>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594604">Guidelines</a></p>
    </b></font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Guidelines for new construction will encourage utilization of design elements 
and materials that are common in Twilight’s historic architectural styles.</p>
<p>The Park works through the Board and Design and Review Committee to review 
and approve all new residential buildings, exterior modifications and additions. 
(See Process for Changes to Cottages and Properties in the first part of the 
Green Book).</p>
<p>Neighboring cottages must approve all plans. The Design and Review Committee 
will pay particular attention to:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. Site Planning</p>
    <dir>
      <p>Setback – conformance to the normal front, side and rear yard setbacks 
      in a way that is aesthetically pleasing to the area.</p>
      <p>Views – respect for neighbors and community views.</p>
      <p>Parking and Vehicle Access – off street access whenever possible to 
      ensure clear access to emergency vehicles.</p>
      <p>Environment – respect for natural surroundings and functional issues 
      such as water run-off.</p>
      <p>Utility/Mechanical Areas – located as inconspicuously as possible, 
      possibly to the rear of the building. Invisible from the road and 
      landscaped, if possible.</p>
    </dir>
    <p>2. Tear Downs</p>
    <p>Tearing down buildings of historic or architectural significance is 
    strongly discouraged. Exceptions will be considered by the Board, based on 
    D&amp;R recommendation.</p>
    <p>3. Scale</p>
    <p>Plans for new constructions must take into consideration situation on 
    lot, proximity to neighbors and impact on the environment.</p>
    <p>4. Architectural Style and Design</p>
    <p>Twilight cottages were largely built in the late 1800s with a 
    predominance of Queen Anne Style. A professional architect should be used 
    who is knowledgeable of and sympathetic to these aims and uses historic 
    elements and quality materials common to the houses of Twilight, e.g.</p>
    <dir>
      <p>Natural Materials – Clapboard, Shingle, Bark siding</p>
      <p>Gable (pitched) Roof</p>
      <p>Inset Porches</p>
      <p>Cross Gables</p>
      <p>Multiple Windows with Decorative Enhancement</p>
      <p>Latticed Foundations</p>
      <p>Upstairs Sleeping Porches</p>
      <p>2+ Floors</p>
      <p>Historic paint colors</p>
    </dir>
    <p>5. Landscaping</p>
    <p>Appropriate to the design and style of Twilight. Includes all visible 
    elements –</p>
    <dir>
      <p>Trees, Bushes, Plants and Ground Covering</p>
      <p>Decorative and Limited Use of Stone Walls (in keeping with local 
      character and materials)</p>
      <p>Retaining walls – Local Stone (with aesthetically pleasing placement 
      and/or landscaping)</p>
      <p>Landscape Lighting to maintain Twilight’s character and reduce ambient 
      light</p>
      <p>Outdoor Furniture and Recreational Items.</p>
    </dir>
    <p>6. Additions and Modifications</p>
    <p>The Guidelines above will apply as is relevant to additions and 
    modifications. Original materials and features that are consistent with good 
    Twilight design and quality should be kept. Deteriorated architectural 
    features, including windows, should be repaired rather then replaced.</p>
    <p>7. Blueprints</p>
    <p>Architectural blueprints are required for all construction. Architectural 
    drawings will be acceptable for alterations or small additions to existing 
    cottages.</p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. Vinyl siding, prefabricated stone foundation siding or foam core 
    stucco exteriors</p>
    <p>2. Concrete or raw sheet metal chimneys</p>
    <p>3. Replacing windows of architectural merit (such as diamond-paned 
    windows) with prefabricated, vinyl windows</p>
    <p>4. Interlocking brick or railroad ties for retaining walls on property 
    that is visible to neighbors or to the street</p>
    <p>5. Unpainted wood or plastic storage sheds</p>
    <p>6. Exterior paint colors and stains that are exceptionally bright</p>
    <p>7. Property line fencing of any kind</p>
    <p>8. Landscape lighting plans that shed an excess amount of ambient light</p>
    <p>9. Recreational play sets containing bright colors or plastic and are 
    visible to neighbors and</p>
    <p>10. Decks with visible underpinnings or railings that are inconsistent 
    with the style of the cottage.</p>

<p>The Guidelines may be changed from time to time to reflect the need to 
maintain the desirable character of Twilight Park.</p>

<p>The Guidelines were created for the benefit of current and prospective 
cottage owners contemplating new residential buildings, exterior modifications 
and additions within Twilight Park. Any plans for such new residential 
buildings, exterior modifications and additions must be submitted for formal 
approval by the Design and Review Committee and, as appropriate, the Board of 
Directors, in accordance with the Process for Changes to Cottages and Properties 
in the Green Book.</p>
<p>Owners will be responsible for compliance with the formally approved plans 
only, and any changes or modifications to the approved plans must be submitted 
to the Design and Review Committee and, as appropriate, the Board of Directors, 
for consideration. Failure to comply with the approved plans will result in 
mandated remedies at owners’ expense.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594608">II. Twilight Park Private Dispute 
Resolution</a></p>
</b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a cottager/cottager dispute arises involving a tangible (e.g., land) or 
intangible (e.g., views, quality of life) asset or other property of the Park, 
where a resolution is not provided by existing Park rules (hereinafter defined 
as a &quot;Private Dispute&quot;), there is a strong presumption that the Board of 
Directors should abstain from resolving such disputes.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font SIZE="4"><b>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594609">Background</a></p>
    </b></font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Disputes arise in many forms and the Board of Directors should retain 
flexibility to handle the specifics of each situation as it sees fit. Clearly, 
if a dispute involves the enforcement of existing Park rules as established in 
the By-Laws, the Proprietary Lease or Park rules, then such a dispute is no 
longer a private matter between cottagers, and the Board may act within its 
powers and in accordance with existing rules to enforce such rules. This type of 
issue is not considered a &quot;Private Dispute&quot; among cottagers and it is not the 
subject of this discussion.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font SIZE="4"><b>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594610">Reasons for Abstention</a></p>
    </b></font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<u>
<p>First, Litigation Risk to Twilight</u>: To the extent the Board becomes a 
party in any dispute and in potential litigation between cottagers, the 
Community as a whole is exposed to legal and financial risk. The Board’s 
priority must be to protect the overall Park from all risk, including legal 
liability.</p>
<u>
<p>Second, Unfair Role for Board Members</u>: The Twilight Board is a group of 
volunteers drawn from a relatively small community. Asking members to get 
involved in resolving an issue where there may be no good objective criteria for 
resolution puts Board members in a difficult and even unfair position and may 
discourage future Board candidates.</p>
<u>
<p>Third, the notion of an &quot;ultimate authority&quot; to resolve disputes is against 
the traditional spirit of Twilight</u>: Twilight has a history of neighborly 
support (Charles Wingate called it &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot;) and we want to 
encourage neighbors to work out their differences among themselves. The Board 
Members, as leaders and representatives of the Twilight community, should 
advance the community spirit by trying to solve disputes amicably vs. 
adjudicating them. Setting up a permanent body of people and rules may in fact 
encourage people to resort to this alternative instead of addressing issues in 
the spirit of Twilight that was so eloquently described by a number of cottagers 
at the August 2004 cottagers meeting.</p>

  <dir>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="_Toc173594611">Recommendations</a></p>
    </b></font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>If the Board concludes that a Private Dispute is material to the Park in some 
way, and the cottagers involved are unable to privately reach a solution, the 
Board may decide on its own terms to take any number of actions, including:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. Offering its or its Members’ influence, persuasion, services, etc., to 
    resolve the Private Dispute informally. The Board was extremely active in 
    this manner in the past.</p>
    <p>2. Offering to help establish a mediation procedure if the dispute cannot 
    be settled through bilateral negotiation. Mediation fees, costs, and 
    expenses would be borne equally by the disputants. Each disputant will also 
    bear the fees and expenses of its own counsel and expert witnesses, and all 
    costs incurred in connection with the preparation of its own case.</p>
    <p>3. Offering to help identify a third-party arbitrator, if asked by the 
    cottagers involved, to achieve a final resolution to the dispute.</p>
    <p>4. Offering to take any other actions that the Board believes in good 
    faith will help resolve the dispute. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Finally, the Committee concluded that in a Private Dispute the Board will 
not: </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. Make any determination resolving a dispute</p>
    <p>2. Engage in any sort of quasi-judicial action or make any sort of 
    quasi-judicial findings</p>
    <p>3. Make any factual findings that might be used in any sort of litigation 
    between the disputing parties</p>
