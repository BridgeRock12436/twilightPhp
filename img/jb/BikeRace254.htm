<br>
On July 30, 31 & August 1st, the third annual Tour of the Catskills road bicycle race will be held on our mountaintop.<br><br>
Over 500 cyclists are expected to participate, double the number from last year!<br><br>
Friday’s time trial will feature a 2.3 mile race up 23-C from the Orpheum in Tannersville to All Soul’s Church.<br><br>
Saturday’s 51 mile race (80 mi. for pros) begins at Windham Mountain and ends in the center of Windham.<br><br>
Sunday’s race begins at Hunter Mountain and ends in the Village of Hunter at the Catskill Mountain Foundation.<br>
On Sunday, the 57 mile ride will include the infamous ‘Devil’s Kitchen’, (Platte Clove Road).<br><br>
We encourage you all to participate by volunteering as road marshals or in another volunteer capacity.<br>
For any of you who would like to ride in the race, we have a 40-mile non-competitive ride on Sunday.<br><br>

A number of the pro teams are looking for host housing for both Friday and Saturday nights.<br><br>
