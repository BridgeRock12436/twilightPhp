We are going to offer the summer playgroup starting July 5 and ending August 20<br>
for children ages 3-7.<br><br>
We are going to charge the same price as last year, but it will include daily tennis taught by Matt Roll (no more surprise bills at the end!) arts and crafts, swimming, lunch and playground time 9-1.<br><br>
The 3&4 year olds are in one group, and 5-7 is in the other.<br><br>
The cost is $200 per week. If you pay in full by June 1st, there is a 10% discount.<br><br>
In order to reserve space for your child, please send a deposit of $50 per week per child to:<br>
Robin Kaukonen<br>30 Underhill Rd.<br>Mill Valley, CA  94941<br><br>
Please note your childs name, age, and week(s) that you are signing up for.<br><br>
INVITE YOUR FRIENDS!!<br><br>
ALL THE PARKS ARE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE!<br><br>


As for the older kids, so many of them seem bored with the playgroup, so we have been running into trouble with planning.<br><br>
We will NOT be doing anything organized for them. Darren has a tennis clinic for them T&Th from 9-12, and there are golf & tennis lessons over in Onteora.<br><br>
Sugar Maples also has an excellent art camp that goes from 10-4, so we will try to arrange a car pool over there for kids interested.<br>
The link for Sugar Maples camp is http://www.catskillmtn.org/sugar-maples/youth-program/index.html.<br><br>
Additionally, Michael Wedd will be offering piano lessons throughout the summer.<br>
