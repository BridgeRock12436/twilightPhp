Construction of your new summer library is underway! <br>
<br>
<br>
Please join members of the Haines Falls Free Library trustees and representatives of the Friends of the Library for a breakfast of Coffee and Donuts on Sunday, May 24th at 10am at The Twilight Park Clubhouse.

The very brief agenda includes an update and progress report on the status of the new Mountain Top Library and Learning Center and an opportunity for you to give input on the programs and services you would like to see at the new facility.
