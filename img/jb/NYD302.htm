                                               New Year's Day Open House at Ledge End<br><br>

The extended MacGahan/Spitko/Poremba clan invite everyone to the resumption of a Twilight Park tradition.<br>
What better way to greet the New Year (or possibly recover from the same named eve) than with warm food, bracing drink and the scintillating company of friends and neighbors? The doors open at 1 PM; your time table is your own.  Stop by before (or after) winter sports activities, settle in with a bowl game or two, sit by the fire and catch up on the latest gossip and/or breaking news of the day.<br><br>
All are welcome and we look forward to seeing you January 1, 2011!
