<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In your mailboxes at the gatehouse there are boil water notices for<br>
twilight. These are strictly precautionary. Our chlorinator acted up (For<br>
the first time this year), at the same time the DOH inspector was here, so<br>
we have to follow the state procedures for a lapse in disinfection. The<br>
chlorinator is now working and there is a chlorine residual throughout the<br>
park. The boil water ban order will be lifted as soon as we get the results<br>
of two tests next week, I'll let you know  as soon as I get them.<br>
On a related note, please don't bring dogs go in the upper reservoir as<br>
this is our source of drinking water. the lower reservoir can be used for<br>
any recreational purpose.<br>
