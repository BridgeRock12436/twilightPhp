&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Vestry of the Memorial Church of All Angels will be conducting the Service of Lessons and Carols
<br>on Sunday, December 27, 2009 at 1:00 p.m.  The Elders have graciously volunteered to host the service for us once more.
<br>Everyone who attended last year's service had a wonderful time, and so we want to continue what we hope will become
<br>another Twilight tradition!<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Please save the date on your calendar and join us as we celebrate this beautiful holiday!
<br>
Volunteers for hors d'oeuvres or wine are greatly appreciated!<br>
