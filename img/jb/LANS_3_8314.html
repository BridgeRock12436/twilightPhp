Dear Cottagers,<br>
</font></p>
<br><br><br>
<p><font size="5" color="black">
We, Twilight Park, were approached by AT&T with the proposal that they erect<br>
a cell tower on our property. This came at a time when the board was<br>
searching for new sources of income. The Board unanimously voted to explore<br>
the possibility. And we have. As part of this process an attorney was hired<br>
to help us understand what would be involved. That lawyer, respected in the<br>
field and referred by several sources was paid , I believe, $2,000.00 which<br>
would be recouped if the tower were to be erected. The Board has been<br>
neutral on the subject, neither advocating nor dismissing. We feel that this<br>
is an issue that should be brought to all cottagers. Based on the response<br>
of all members of the community an appropriate and wise decision could be<br>
made. No commitments have been made. No other actions have been taken.<br>
Again. the Board remains neutral on this topic. No matter how else it has<br>
been portrayed we are trying to carry forth with the best interests of the<br>
entire community.<br>
<br><br>
It would be irresponsible on the Board's part to not bring this matter to<br>
the entire community to consider.<br>
<br><br>
 On the day of our Memorial Day picnic there will be a meeting in the<br>
clubhouse where we invite all to come and ask questions, voice concerns,<br>
express opinions.<br>
<br><br>
 <br>
<br>
Respectfully, <br>
<br><br>
Allan<br>
